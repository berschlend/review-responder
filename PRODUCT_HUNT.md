## Maker Comment Draft

```
Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Berend, and I built ReviewResponder because I was tired of spending hours crafting responses to customer reviews.

The problem: Every business owner knows they should respond to reviews - it boosts SEO, builds trust, and shows customers you care. But writing thoughtful, unique responses takes forever.

The solution: ReviewResponder uses AI to generate professional, personalized responses in seconds. Just paste the review, pick your tone (Professional, Friendly, Formal, or Apologetic), and you're done.

What makes it special:
- Any language with auto-detect
- Chrome Extension for Google Maps - respond without leaving the page
- Add your business context once, get personalized responses forever
- 4 different tones to match any situation

We just launched and are offering 50% off for early adopters (code: EARLY50).

I'd love your feedback! What features would make this even more useful for your business?

Thanks for checking us out!
