Since the dealership is about 100 miles away, I asked about transportation options. The representative I spoke with, Amanda, offered to check with management to see if a complimentary pickup was possible and would get back to me by the end of the day. I did not receive a return call.\n\nOver the next several days, I left multiple messages and made follow-up calls. When I reached her again, she did not remember our previous conversation at first, and after I refreshed her memory, she said the vehicle was too old for a courtesy pickup. I then asked for a quote for a paid pickup service. She told me she would speak with management and call me back that day. Again, I received no call.\n\nI made one more attempt and left another message, but as of today, I still have not received a return call.\n\nI am disappointed with the lack of follow-through and communication, especially given the expectations that typically accompany the Rolls-Royce name. I hope the dealership will review this experience and improve responsiveness for future customers.\n\nUpdate December 8, 2025:\n\nI received a follow-up call from the service manager after posting my review, and I appreciate that he took the time to reach out. He explained that the department had been short-staffed due to his attendance at a manufacturer conference.\n\nOn my initial call, Amanda did mention that she needed to speak with management before giving me an answer, and I appreciated that transparency. The concern was not that she needed guidance; it was that she assured me she would call back the same day, and no call ever came. After several additional attempts on my part, I still received no follow-up.\n\nWhile I appreciate the courtesy of the manager’s call, the explanation did not fully resolve the underlying issue. Even if short-staffed, a quick message acknowledging the delay or letting me know a decision would have to wait until management returned would have set clear expectations. Instead, the lack of communication over several days made the process more difficult than it needed to be.\n\nThe follow-up call did confirm that the challenge was not simply workload but a breakdown in communication and follow-through. I hope this feedback helps the department strengthen those areas going forward.\n\nAt this time, I believe my original rating remains accurate based on the full experience.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Rob S.","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5110,"business_name":"blumen company","business_type":"florist","address":"Rumfordstraße 43, 80469 München, Germany","city":"München","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"089 29161055","website":"http://www.blumencompany.de/","google_rating":"5.0","google_reviews_count":10,"email":"info@blumencompany.de","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T22:00:51.142Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5092,"business_name":"Premier Pharmacy","business_type":"pharmacy","address":"4900 Oak St, Berlin, OH 44610, USA","city":"Berlin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(330) 893-0290","website":"http://www.premierpharmacy.net/","google_rating":"4.9","google_reviews_count":16,"email":"j-gause@premierpharmacy.net","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T22:00:45.839Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5072,"business_name":"OPTICA DUBLIN","business_type":"optician","address":"6 Dawson St, Dublin 2, D02 E763, Ireland","city":"Dublin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(01) 677 4705","website":"http://www.opticadublin.com/","google_rating":"3.5","google_reviews_count":82,"email":"info@optica.ie","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T22:00:39.907Z","worst_review_text":"Never have I ever been treated with such arrogance and conceit as a customer.

Secondly considering the abysmal price tag you would think the customer service would be amazing. Well you would be wrong. The girls at the reception got my name and surname wrong on the invoice and then when i emailed them about it i never got a reply. When i was choosing the frames downstairs nobody helped me. And usually opticians are supposed to help you choose the right frame that sit on your nose correctly and don’t feel tight. None of that happened either. I chose the frames myself and they sent me on my way, nobody asked any questions at all. I feel like they were all a bit lackluster when it came to customer service (let me remind you the cost was 320 eur). So i will never come back and don’t advise you to. My husband went to Specsavers dundrum (not sure about any other location) and he got two pairs of glasses for the same price as me and their customer service was so much better.

When I arrived to view the car, Jahid only offered a quick test drive around the car park, and I had to insist on a proper road test. During the viewing, it also became clear that Jahid did not appear to know much about this specific car when I asked him questions, and he seemed more interested in taking personal calls while I was trying to sort the paperwork with him. The vehicle itself was faultless and accurately described.\n\nI proceeded with a finance agreement and a £1700 RAC Platinum warranty, although the terms and conditions were not fully explained to me at the time. I decided to cancel the warranty less than a week after purchasing the car. The sales manager, James, initially said he didn’t know how to process a cancellation and claimed no customer had ever asked before. He later said he did know, and that the refund would take 7–10 days.\n\nI have since seen online that my warranty policy has been cancelled, yet no refund has been issued by Cargem. Despite multiple messages, emails, and phone calls, I’ve been completely ignored by the sales staff and still have not received any acknowledgement or explanation.\n\nThis level of customer service is completely unacceptable.

I get my truck back from the shop and I took all the fender flares off because they were all falling off anyways.

It was a disappointing reminder of why I hadn’t purchased from a dealership in 8 years.\n\nThe car I chose had a sticker price of $23,777. After taxes and “document fees,” the salesman presented me a written quote of $26,267—the higher end of my $28,000 budget, but still manageable. Confident in the purchase, I even went ahead and bought insurance for the car.\n\nThat’s when the circus began. We arrived at 4:00 p.m. and were kept waiting for hours. Not called back until 7:45 p.m., nearly an hour after closing, exhausted and ready to sign. And that’s exactly what they were banking on.\n\nWhen the finance manager finally slid the paperwork across the desk, my pen was literally on the page when I noticed the numbers. That $26,000 “deal”? Suddenly it had ballooned to over $30,000. No explanation. No disclosure. Just “sign here.”\n\nAnd why? Because they had quietly tacked on thousands in worthless warranties and add-ons I never asked for. Things no one bothered to explain—just slipped in, hoping I’d be too tired or too trusting to notice. The only comments I heard were, “oh, we have a warranty on it” and “we’ll throw in the gap on us!” Throw in? No—sneak in.\n\nWhen I called out this deceit, the manager insisted he’d given me a “great deal.” In what world does a $23,000 car magically becoming a $30,000 purchase qualify as a deal? To make matters worse, when I said no one told me the price increase, he brushed it off with, “I told you what the monthly payments would be.” As if anyone would assume a $26,000 quote somehow meant a $30,000 loan.\n\nThis dealership didn’t just lose a sale—they proved exactly why people hate buying cars.

They provided me the refund link with wrong details 4 times before I finally got my refund.\n\nDuring the test drive, we noticed the car was pulling to the left. We immediately raised this with the salesperson, it was noted in the paperwork, and we were assured it would be fixed before collection. we even phoned Cargiant before pickup to double check, and they confirmed the issue had been resolved.\n\nHowever, when we collected the car, it still had the exact same fault. Despite promising they would only release the car to customer once it was fixed and safe to drive, they knowingly handed us a faulty vehicle. The very next morning, we emailed them again to report the problem.\n\nFrom there, aftercare has been appalling. When we reported the fault, we were told to take the car to KwikFit. However, when KwikFit tried to contact Cargiant for authorisation, their calls were not answered. We even had to phone Cargiant ourselves and hand the phone to the KwikFit mechanic, only for them to later confirm that they could not identify fault. We then tried four different garages, including the ones recommended by Cargiant and none were able to diagnose the issue.\n\nWhen we asked Cargiant to handle the repair directly, the earliest appointment they offered was over a month away, and when we asked how long the repair would take, they did not give us an estimate. We also requested a courtesy car to cover the period without a vehicle, but this was refused. We then asked if they would cover our expenses for repeated drop-offs and pick-ups, which they also refused. Finally, we asked if they could collect and return the car themselves to save us further inconvenience, and again they refused.\n\nMeanwhile, we rely on this car for work and daily needs. The amount of time, stress, and inconvenience this caused has been giant, all because Cargiant released a faulty and unsafe car instead of ensuring it was properly repaired.\n\nAs a last resort, we asked to return the vehicle. They gave us a appointment date two weeks later. When we went to drop it off yesterday, staff had no idea we were there to return the car, they thought we were booked in for fault inspection. We had to show them the email confirmation proving we were there to return the car.\n\nYesterday, we’ve dropped the car off and now waiting for their “internal inspection”. If they do not handle this fairly and promptly, we are prepared to take legal action and report them to the relevant authorities, including Trading Standards and The Motor Ombudsman.\n\nWe will keep this review updated. After this experience, We cannot recommend Cargiant. Once the sale is done, their support is dismissive, unhelpful, and completely fails to take accountability for selling a faulty car.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Muneeb Ahmed","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":4267,"business_name":"Showcase Flowers","business_type":"florist","address":"325 Mason St, San Francisco, CA 94102, USA","city":"San Francisco","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(415) 771-8323","website":"http://www.showcaseflowers.com/","google_rating":"4.1","google_reviews_count":50,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T02:00:48.654Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":4252,"business_name":"UF Health Jacksonville Pharmacy","business_type":"pharmacy","address":"855 8th St W, Jacksonville, FL 32209, USA","city":"Jacksonville","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(904) 244-3333","website":"https://ufhealthjax.org/pharmacy","google_rating":"2.9","google_reviews_count":39,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T02:00:43.904Z","worst_review_text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE TODAY picking up my Rx refill.

She said my ID info wasn’t in the EMR so she had to re-enter my drivers license info in again? The medication requires cold packing, and has  always previously been done but not today. I asked for the cold packing and she responded “I’ll have to find someone to do that” while clearly annoyed. She then STILL placed my medication into a brown paper bag to give to me. I again, stated it needed to be cold packed at which time I asked for a manager. UF Health has had an unfavorable  reputation with regard to patient experiences and it appears work still needs to be done to improve in this area. I waited and a woman “Julie “ approached the window to speak to me. I asked if she was the manager but she stated she was the pharmacist for the day. Either the manager didn’t care to speak to me or they didn’t let him or her know there was a customer requesting them. I was not surprised and went on to relay my experience to Julie who listened but I must mention gave me the clear impression my complaint probably would go anywhere. I left but had to regrettably go back inside to get a receipt for my FSA records. The gentleman who provided my receipt was the same one who iced and gave me my medication earlier. I wish I had gotten his name because he was the only employee displaying any sense of an interaction in line with positive patient experiences.

For the last 6 months, I have had to deal with continual grief in getting my prescriptions refilled and in getting new prescriptions filled.  Three months ago, I called the automated phone number for refills of my prescriptions to be picked up at the Satellite Pharmacy pick up window and was given a day when they would be available for pickup.  I went to the Satellite Pharmacy on that date, sat in my car for over 2 hours in line and once I got to the window, was informed they had one of the four prescriptions I called in, but didn't have the others.  I ended up going to the main hospital pharmacy to get the snafu fixed and my medications filled.  To activate new prescriptions, you have to go onto the Genesis patient portal, which is a nightmare in itself as you have to change your password every 60 days.  This normally would not be an issue, but you have to pick a password that doesn't utilize any of the same letters or characters used in the last 50 or so passwords used.  Anyway, I had managed to do this and indicated that I needed to activate my new prescriptions and wanted them sent to the Satellite Pharmacy pick up window, which was verified by the pharmacy technician via message on the Genesis patient portal.  Now today, I waited in my car in line for over 2 hours only to be told I had to go inside the building to pick up my medications via a pharmacy kiosk!  I went inside and then left after seeing a line of over 30 people waiting to pick up their medications!  If you try to speak to anybody about this they just give you a stupid look and tell you there isn't anything that can be done about it!

purchased a 2020 Jeep Compass from this dealership in March. Just after Christmas, the vehicle completely broke down. The day before it died, I could press the gas but the car would not go faster than 15 miles per hour.\n\nBecause the vehicle was under warranty, I had it towed to the dealership. The day I dropped it off, no one even looked at the car. The following afternoon, I was told by an associate named Nicholas that it needed a new battery and that the sway bar might be covered under the warranty.\n\nThroughout every interaction—both on the phone and in person—Nicholas spoke down to me in a condescending manner. As a woman, I felt I was not taken seriously and was treated as if I didn’t understand basic information, even though the information he provided was incomplete and unclear. He repeatedly interrupted me, would not allow me to ask standard questions, and ultimately hung up on me.\n\nI was later contacted again and told that the sway bar would be covered, but with a $100 deductible. After that, I spoke with the manager, Dave, who did not apologize for the situation and simply answered questions about the parts, stating it would take another day to complete the repairs.\n\nSpending three days in the shop for a battery and sway bar is unreasonable for a dealership that claims to be professional. This is not a small, independent shop—it is a dealership.\n\nOverall, I would recommend going elsewhere to purchase a vehicle. It is ridiculous to have to pay for a battery on a car that was purchased less than a year ago, especially when the warranty turned out to be essentially useless.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Cassandra

My doctor prescribed a 10-day supply of pain medication, including extra strength Tylenol and Oxycodone (Roxicodone). However, the pharmacist informed me that neither my primary nor secondary insurance would cover a 10-day supply of Roxicodone, which seems unusual given that I previously received a  morphine prescription for previous tonsil abscesses without issue. These medications were for a surgery with general anesthesia.\n\nDespite my concerns, I accepted a 7-day supply of Roxicodone and paid for it, wanting to get home after a long day at the hospital. When I counted the pills before going to sleep, I found that I only received a 6-day supply. I wanted to call the pharmacy as soon as possible given the circumstances and the fact that it had been 6 hours since they were filled, but they were closed. When I called the pharmacy this morning to address this, the pharmacist dismissed my concerns, claiming that a mistake was impossible. He begged to differ and this was a sensitive accusation.\n\nI understand the sensitivity of accusing someone of mishandling narcotics, but I am certain I did not receive the full amount prescribed. I asked the pharmacist if there was a way to review any videos or if a second person verifies the pill count? Given the severity of my pain and the upcoming Memorial Day weekend, this is a significant issue. The 500mg Tylenol I have is not enough to manage my post-surgery pain.\n\nI am very disappointed with the patient care at UCSD Hillcrest's pharmacy and will not be filling future prescriptions there.

There was one of the waiters who was quite friendly with dark hair, but the whole experience was actually almost traumatic from the absolute rudeness by one of the staff members, the bald guy who seem to also have a dog. He was serving customers but so arrogant and very disrespectful and ignoring women when they wanted to be served. I watched him do this to other people not just to us.

review aims to raise awareness and share a community experience in a professional and respectful manner.\n\nMy experience with Haytham Faraj and Matthew following an Uber car accident was disappointing and concerning. Despite their claims as trial lawyers, they pressured me into accepting a premature settlement, disregarding my ongoing medical needs. Their insistence on visiting specific doctors, seemingly to manipulate medical records, and their unprofessional behavior including threats and questionable conduct, led me to file a complaint against them with the bar association. I caution others against trusting them, as my experience suggests they prioritize financial gain over ethical legal representation and client care.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Mo Rashwan","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2692,"business_name":"Europa Hair Studio Miami","business_type":"hair salon","address":"3530 Coral Wy Suite R-1, Miami, FL 33145, USA","city":"Miami","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(305) 720-2277","website":"https://www.europahairstudio.com/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":622,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:11:11.461Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2691,"business_name":"STATUS Hair Salon - Brickell","business_type":"hair salon","address":"777 Brickell Ave #170, Miami, FL 33131, USA","city":"Miami","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(305) 306-8238","website":"https://www.nycchichair.com/?utm_campaign=GoogleMyBusiness","google_rating":"4.8","google_reviews_count":699,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:11:11.232Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2690,"business_name":"Red Lion Auto Repair","business_type":"auto repair shop","address":"555 NW 79th St, Miami, FL 33150, USA","city":"Miami","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(786) 530-9995","website":"http://www.redlionauto.com/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":357,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:11:10.110Z","worst_review_text":"So again for further clarification.

If you are experts in your field you would have done your research correctly before taking my car just to get a free charge from me. If you knew based on the fault code that a teardown would be needed you should have clearly communicated that.\n\nAlso your cashier said the full diagnostic would cover the cost of finding out the issue and the cost of it, in which he misinformed me. An additional test needed is not a diagnostic of the vehicle.

NEVER GO!!\n\nI recently had my manual transmission car's clutch replaced at this shop, with an initial quote of around $1300 (with generous first time customer discount of 15%) and a promised completion time of one day. So, I got my car sent to them via AAA. However, they later informed me that the shaft seal, flywheel, and transmission mount also needed replacement, bringing the total bill to $1600.\n\nWhat was surprising was that the same parts were available at half the price at AutoZone. After paying the bill, I noticed the engine light came on during my drive home. The repair shop suggested I come back the next day for a check, which revealed a clutch circuit sensor issue and an oil smell.\n\nThey wanted to charge $125 for a diagnostic test, but I requested they check the wiring instead. As expected, it was a wiring issue, likely from the transmission work. However, the manager was uncooperative and didn't address the oil smell.\n\nA week later, I took my car to another shop for a wheel rotation and asked them to investigate the oil smell. They found a transmission leak, attributing it to improper fitting during the clutch replacement. When I contacted the original shop, the manager was again unhelpful, suggesting I drop off the car for a day and pay for another diagnostic. They eventually told me the entire gearbox needed replacement with any written estimate.\n\nOverall, the service was subpar, with significant issues arising shortly after the repair. The lack of transparency and customer service was disappointing.\n\nAfter I posted the review on Yelp, the owner threatened me with a text on my private number.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"p h","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2680,"business_name":"Herb Chambers MINI of Boston Service Center","business_type":"auto repair shop","address":"1168 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02134, USA","city":"Boston","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(617) 731-1700","website":"https://www.herbchambersmini.com/?utm_source=google%20my%20business&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=visit%20website","google_rating":"4.9","google_reviews_count":651,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:10:59.385Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2679,"business_name":"Serpa Law Office","business_type":"law firm","address":"20 Park Plaza #400A, Boston, MA 02116, USA","city":"Boston","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(617) 936-0201","website":"https://serpalaw.com/","google_rating":"5.0","google_reviews_count":216,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:10:58.349Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2678,"business_name":"1 Mi Taller Auto Repair","business_type":"auto repair shop","address":"51-06 70th St, Woodside, NY 11377, USA","city":"New York","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(718) 424-7289","website":"http://mitallerauto.com/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":217,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:10:56.084Z","worst_review_text":"They are the worst.\nTook long time to retouch (painting) my car.\nThey didn’t use prime when painting.\nThe paint it’s pealing now.\nThey wanted the job because it was through insurance.

They never responded to emails and for workers comp, my husband was not getting any pay checks. We needed an appointment for workers comp and they just kept saying we were are waiting. My husband was the sole provider for our family at the time and we relied on the income for food and everyday essentials. After weeks went on with no appointment, my husband took it into his own hands to call workers comp over and over again day after day to try to get an appointment. He finally received one, no thanks to Percman. Additionally, for our court hearing the lawyer “ED” only called my husband minutes before the meeting, with little information about what was going to go on in the hearing. Broken leg and ankle, 2 emergency surgies and we never received a dollar. Workers comp never even payed back for ice packs, pillows that I puchased.\nFurthermore, This firm's lack of attention, poor communication, and inability to deliver on their initial assurances turned an already difficult situation into a financial nightmare. All they did was provide a disservice to our family. I would strongly caution anyone considering this law firm for a worker's compensation claim to look elsewhere.\n\nThanks for nothing Percman.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Rosina christian","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2662,"business_name":"Holiday Inn Hamburg - Berliner Tor, an IHG Hotel","business_type":"hotel","address":"Wikingerweg 2, 20537 Hamburg, Germany","city":"Hamburg","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"040 3346490","website":"https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/gb/en/hamburg/hamef/hoteldetail?cm_mmc=GoogleMaps-_-HI-_-DE-_-HAMEF","google_rating":"4.2","google_reviews_count":2236,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:10:08.232Z","worst_review_text":".Staff was extremely rude and unprofessional.\n.Check-in time was 3 PM, but rooms were not\nready even till 5:30 PM.

had previously visited the Vi Café in Zurich and was not satisfied. This time, I tried the Basel location today, hoping for a better experience.\n\nIt was very cold outside, so I ordered a hot drink: a chai latte with oat milk. Unfortunately, the drink I received was clearly cold.\n\nWhen I asked if it could be reheated or remade, I was told very firmly that this was “not possible.” I honestly could not understand how reheating or remaking a chai latte could be considered impossible. This is not a language issue — the explanation simply did not make sense.\n\nAt one point, the staff member touched the cup and insisted that it was warm. Even if it felt warm to them, it was not warm to me. Temperature is subjective, and what matters is the customer’s experience.\n\nI drink coffee and hot beverages outside regularly and do not make a habit of sending drinks back. Expecting a hot drink to be hot is not an unreasonable request. Being treated as if I were asking for something extraordinary was uncomfortable and unprofessional.\n\nIn the end, I drank the chai latte only because I had paid for it. I did not enjoy it at all. This experience made me seriously question how much customer satisfaction is valued.\n\nNever again.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Mina

attended several sessions at this clinic, and unfortunately I cannot recommend their services for the following reasons:\n\nDuring treatment with Jelmer for a shoulder injury, I was referred and scheduled to see Lennard for a different issue on 12 December at 2:00 PM. However, on that day I received an automated confirmation email stating that the appointment was at 12:00 PM. I arrived at the clinic at the time indicated in the email and waited for 40 minutes, only to be informed that no appointment had been scheduled for me that day—despite having a written confirmation email clearly stating otherwise.\n\nA new appointment was then scheduled for the following week, which proceeded as expected.\n\nSubsequently, a follow-up session was booked for 5 January at 12:00 PM. On the day of the appointment, I received again a confirmation email—this time at 10:48 AM—stating that my appointment was at 11:00 AM, creating yet another discrepancy in their scheduling system.\n\nI attempted to clarify this by calling four times and sending an email to confirm whether the appointment time had changed or was still set for 12:00 PM. I received no response whatsoever. Given that this was the second instance of conflicting information, the lack of communication, and the proximity to the appointment time, I couldn’t not attend it, and to avoid once again wasting time traveling to a potentially nonexistent appointment.\n\nDespite these circumstances, I was later issued an invoice of €50 for a missed appointment—even though the confirmation they provided was incorrect and all reasonable efforts were made on my part to verify the booking.\n\nOverall, the clinic demonstrated a lack of respect for clients’ time and availability and failed to take accountability for repeated administrative errors. Additionally, I did not notice any improvement in my condition following the sessions, which further reinforces that the service was not worth the time or cost.\n\nJust be aware, can be you next time.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Guilherme Brandão","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2619,"business_name":"The Dick Vet General Practice","business_type":"veterinary clinic","address":"Easter Bush Campus, Edinburgh EH25 9RG, UK","city":"Edinburgh","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0131 650 7650","website":"https://www.ed.ac.uk/vet/services/small-animals/appointments","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":57,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:01:28.812Z","worst_review_text":"The incompetence and disregard for the health of my cat is mind-blowing.  I came to see the Vet as my cat seemed to have a urinary infection and bloody urine.  After the exam and medication that was prescribed, I was asked to bring in a urine sample from the cat the next day.  I brought the sample in early Thurs morning, and it was very red/bloody. I did not get a call back about the results, so on the next Tuesday (they had the sample for 6 days) at around 10, I called. I got a call back just before 4 from a nurse who told me the BLOODY SAMPLE WAS SITTING ON THE RECEPTION DESK FOR 6 DAYS.  The nurse wanted to know if I wanted the sample sent in since it was old and the result may not be accurate.  THERE WAS NO MENTION OF TALKING TO A VET OR MANAGEMENT ABOUT THE ISSUE. AND NO CONCERN FOR THE HEALTH OF MY CAT. I had to determine what to do with the sample. I asked to speak to a manager, and she told me not to expect a call back for 2-3 days!! Not believing the message would be relayed, I called back an hour later and asked to talk to a manager or a vet. I still could not get past the receptionist. I was told to email my complaint.  THERE WAS NO ONE IN CHANGE IN ANY MANNER THAT I COULD SPEAK TO NOR COULD I SPEAK TO A SENIOR VET. I asked to have a Vet call me as I had no idea what to do and was concerned about my cat.  The receptionist could not understand why I wanted to talk to a Vet. I had to explain why I would be concerned about my cat, who had bloody urine compounded by their mistake. You would think Dicks Vet of the University of Edinburgh would be first and for most a veterinarian practice.  The bloody sample sat on the desk for 6 days, and how many receptionists saw it and did nothing.  Why when I called and the mistake discovered was a vet not consulted for advice about what to do FOR THE HEALTH OF THE ANIMAL before calling me. The whole things was just covered up! I still have not spoken to a Vet.\n\nUpdate: later in the evening, I did receive a call from a Vet who was amazingly kind and understanding.  She seemed to really understand the concerns was that no thought had been given to my pet.  So I am happy with the Vet response.  I still have concerns regarding the receptionist and the nurse.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Adam Blum","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2618,"business_name":"The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","business_type":"veterinary clinic","address":"Easter Bush Campus, Midlothian EH25 9RG, UK","city":"Edinburgh","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0131 651 7300","website":"http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/vet","google_rating":"4.6","google_reviews_count":102,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:01:28.579Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2617,"business_name":"The Hospital for Small Animals","business_type":"veterinary clinic","address":"The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, The University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush Campus, Midlothian EH25 9RG, UK","city":"Edinburgh","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0131 650 7650","website":"https://www.ed.ac.uk/vet/services/small-animals","google_rating":"4.8","google_reviews_count":150,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:01:28.351Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2616,"business_name":"Kimpton Charlotte Square Hotel","business_type":"spa","address":"38 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh EH2 4HQ, UK","city":"Edinburgh","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0131 240 5500","website":"https://www.ihg.com/kimptonhotels/hotels/us/en/charlotte-square-hotel-edinburgh-uk/edics/hoteldetail","google_rating":"4.6","google_reviews_count":1769,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:01:27.431Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2614,"business_name":"IULA BAIA SPA","business_type":"spa","address":"38 Dame Street -

I decided to go into town that Morning to the business itself and speak to them in person in the hopes that this will be sorted! Staff then told me to send an email and their manager will contact me!!! I proceeded in explaining my situation so they asked me to leave a phone number to be contacted by the manager (Maureen) once she is back.\nAlthough I had already shared my contact information via email with her, I did that again with the staff and left. I finally received a call at 7:30pm that day to tell me that there is no availability for another FIVE Weeks.\n\nTHE TREATMENT:\n\nThe Massage was OK. I cannot say that it was bad however it certainly was not good.\n\nThe Facial was decent. I actually think that the products that were used and the technique were good.\n\nThe head massage was not good and I personally found it to be annoying as I specifically asked twice for no oils/creams to be used on my scalp/hair for medical reasons however my request was completely ignored which is very ignorant.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI am not sure I would recommend this place as there are multiple other, much professional options in this price range.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"M.

recently visited the Four Seasons for afternoon tea and, unfortunately, the experience was disappointing and fell well below the standard expected of a five-star hotel.\n\nUpon arrival, we waited approximately 45 minutes for the tea & food to arrive, which significantly affected the overall experience.\n\nWhen the food was finally served, the savoury selection was very limited in quantity compared to the sweet items, creating an unbalanced offering. Additionally, all items were served at the same time. While this made for an attractive presentation, it resulted in hot items such as the scones and sticky toffee pudding with sauce becoming cold by the time we reached them.\n\nThat said, the food itself was very delicious, which made the service and timing issues particularly disappointing. Additionally, if you are expecting a traditional afternoon tea experience, this is not the one — it felt more like all snacks being served at the same time, rather than a paced afternoon tea service.\n\nThroughout the experience, no additional hot water for the tea was offered, which is a basic expectation for afternoon tea service. Furthermore, when we enquired about the possibility of a small savoury top-up, we were informed that this would be chargeable. This is not standard practice at most afternoon tea venues and is particularly surprising at a hotel of the Four Seasons’ calibre.\n\nOverall, the experience did not meet the expectations associated with a five-star establishment.

was very much looking forward to my appointment. It's a long story I had already written a review but I took down my post. I do feel writing this is necessary. I was unimpressed with the staff. I did appreciate Edda calling me to try and make things right, but of course this was after my review. So to me it felt like she was only calling so I could take my review down. This whole experience has left a bad taste. I don't trust this salon anymore the beginning was terrible. Please have your receptionist trained better. When I received the call my appointment was being canceled. The verbiage was \" Edda was being pulled in multiple directions and won't reschedule me.\" Lots of Umms and Uhh with the person I spoke to, He was not nice at all. Very rude and condescending. This was after a 250$ deposit. A couple days later when I spoke to Edda she did apologize and said \" I am sorry you were caught in the cross fire of everything\". Such a weird way to go about things. Yes life happens, but I was a new client to build a report like this was a terrible way to go about it. After thinking about it, I truly just feel disappointed and I won't be returning. I hope I am the only client they have done this too. And I hope that whenever they book new Clients they don't overbook themselves since that is what happened to me. In the end I wound up finding a MUCH nicer hair salon that. didn't charge me 250$ deposit and it was way cheaper. The last thing id like to add is that this hair salon is so overly priced even for Chicago and there are many much nicer places.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Melanie Georgens","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2592,"business_name":"Le Hair Salon","business_type":"hair salon","address":"8236 W Flagler St, Miami, FL 33144, USA","city":"Miami","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(786) 803-5246","website":"https://lehairsalonmiami.com/","google_rating":"4.8","google_reviews_count":409,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:58:35.432Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2591,"business_name":"James styles hair salón","business_type":"hair salon","address":"8631 Coral Wy Suite 128, Miami, FL 33155, USA","city":"Miami","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(305) 588-1645","website":"https://app.landingsite.ai/website-preview?id=e5eef285-8cb6-4735-b5d0-5bb274a7de19","google_rating":"5.0","google_reviews_count":462,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:58:35.212Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2590,"business_name":"ALFA GARAGE MIAMI","business_type":"auto repair shop","address":"ALFA GARAGE BUILDING, 3970 NW 27th St, Miami, FL 33142, USA","city":"Miami","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(305) 871-5551","website":"http://alfagaragemiami.com/","google_rating":"5.0","google_reviews_count":488,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:58:34.210Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2589,"business_name":"Piotrowski Law","business_type":"law firm","address":"169 E Flagler St Suite 1600, Miami, FL 33131, USA","city":"Miami","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(305) 204-5000","website":"https://cplaw-miami.com/miami/","google_rating":"5.0","google_reviews_count":366,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:58:33.028Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2588,"business_name":"The Russo Firm -

Based on those representations, I flew from Salt Lake City to Portland specifically to view and potentially purchase the vehicle.\n\nAt the end of the test drive, the car triggered multiple fault codes and a flashing check engine light, which is forgivable considering it was a used car however, while attempting to explain the situation away, the salesperson accidentally showed me text messages from their mechanic confirming that this was a known, recurring issue and that the codes had been cleared previously instead of the underlying problem being properly repaired. This directly contradicted everything I had been told prior to traveling at my own expense, and shows how Columbia Motors chooses to do business.\n\nDespite this clear evidence, the issue was minimized as “just a software update.” After flying back to Salt Lake City and after a month of horrible communication from my salesperson I was later assured that the vehicle had been fully repaired and that the problem had been resolved.\n\nTrusting those assurances, I flew back to Portland a second time. Within approximately 15 minutes of driving the car, the exact same failure occurred again multiple fault codes and a flashing check engine light. When I spoke to the salesman about my frustration from the lack of transparency on our first visit (the known issue and clearing the codes) he of course pretended like it never happened..... At that point, it was undeniable that the issue had not been properly diagnosed or repaired and that the assurances I had been given were simply not accurate and intentionally misleading.\n\nWhat made this experience even more disappointing was the complete lack of accountability afterward. There was no meaningful acknowledgment of the inconvenience, cost, or time lost from two separate trips made solely based on the dealership’s representations. I was told that someone would follow up with a solution, yet no one ever did. Communication stopped, and responsibility was avoided rather than addressed.\n\nThis is not simply a case of a used car having an unexpected issue. This was a known problem that was not disclosed intentionally, minimized repeatedly, and then represented as fixed when it clearly was not. That level of transparency and professionalism is simply unacceptable.\n\nAfter wasting about $1,500 and dealing with months of awful communication I am left without a car, solution or even an apology. After returning from my SECOND trip to Portland I am left with no response from anyone at Columbia Motors. The entire experience was frustrating, costly, and frankly disheartening. I expected basic honesty and professionalism. Instead, I was left feeling misled and disregarded once the problems became inconvenient for the dealership.\n\nWhatever Columbia's response may be know that they do not deal in good faith.\n\nFor your own sake AVOID Columbia Motors at all costs.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Baron

would like to share my experience working with Austin Auto Planet as a 21-year-old young woman. I do feel I was taken advantage of due to my age and this being my first auto loan.\nAt the end of November, I purchased a 2018 Kia Sportage. A family friend and I test drove the car, and when I reached highway speeds to test acceleration, the check engine light immediately came on. There were also a few other concerns I brought up while checking out the car. When I returned from the test drive, the owner said it was a misfire and that he would fix it. I mentioned the other concerns and he brushed them off as not important. I came back later that evening, took the car back out, and the light was off, so I moved forward with the purchase (I should have walked away).\nAfter having the car for only 12 days and roughly 500 miles, while driving to work at the same highway speed (around 70 mph), the check engine light came on again. I immediately called my dad, and he advised me to contact the dealer and try to return the car since this was my first loan. I stopped at AutoZone, where they pulled code P0234, which indicates a turbo overboost condition that can cause serious engine damage if not fixed.\nWhen I brought the car back to the dealership, the owner immediately told me this was a new issue and once again said it was not important. I have him on recording stating that he cleared the original check engine light because the codes were “history,” and while we were test driving the car together, he cleared the check engine light again right in front of me.\nAlthough he offered to fix the car, my bank advised that I try to give it back. I went back and forth with him asking to return the vehicle, but he undermined my concerns and repeatedly brushed them off by saying, “I said I fix it for you.” I ended up leaving the car with him on December 4.\nOn December 6, he told me he needed to order a part and showed me a part listing from eBay. He said the part would arrive between December 10–13. The part arrived on December 16, but it was broken, and the car was not returned to me until December 20. He had my car for 16 days (December 4–20)!!!\n\nDuring this time, I had to Uber to work while working two jobs. I spent $613.72 on Uber while my car sat at his dealership. It wasn’t until the day before the car was fixed that he agreed to provide a loaner vehicle.\n\nThis is not an honest dealership. The owner admitted he does not run safety inspections on his cars and said I should be glad he was “honest enough” to tell me upfront. However, his website claims he sells quality vehicles and performs a rigorous multi-point inspection, which was not my experience at all.\nAfter getting the car back, I took it to my personal mechanic again, and they encouraged me to sell the car and not have anything further to do with this dealership.\n\nPlease be aware of who you are dealing with before purchasing from this lot.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Qiana Stofferahn","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2551,"business_name":"Monkey Nest Coffee","business_type":"coffee shop","address":"5353 Burnet Rd, Austin, TX 78756, USA","city":"Austin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(512) 505-8033","website":"http://monkeynestcoffee.com/","google_rating":"4.4","google_reviews_count":1844,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:55:14.826Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2550,"business_name":"optik atelier käser","business_type":"optician","address":"Blumenrain 21, 4051 Basel, Switzerland","city":"Basel","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"061 281 17 17","website":"https://www.optik-atelier.ch/","google_rating":"5.0","google_reviews_count":96,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:55:13.369Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2549,"business_name":"VIU - Optiker & Brillengeschäft","business_type":"optician","address":"Spalenberg 20, 4051 Basel, Switzerland","city":"Basel","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"044 508 79 12","website":"https://shopviu.com/de-ch/viu-stores/store/basel?utm_source=google_maps&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gmb&utm_content=websitelink&utm_term=basel","google_rating":"4.6","google_reviews_count":178,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:55:13.112Z","worst_review_text":"The current way of hospitality is completely contrary to the original intention of starting this business.\n\nI took my child to the store, hoping to test his eyesight within the three-month warranty period and consider whether the lenses need to be adjusted.

When I was getting glasses, a VIU employee reminded me that there was a three-month warranty period and we could come back for inspection at any time.

Not all my experiences there are bad. But, most of them are.\n1- When i bought my car, the salesman there told me to contact him if i have questions or issues. But, he didn't reply to most of my emails after sale.\n\n2- I went to buy another car. I asked a few questions that another salesman didn't have answers to. He promised to ask and send me back. It never happened.\n\n3- After 8 years and only 65000 km, and in the span of 3 months, i paid ~3500 Euros in repairs for stuff that just broke in the engine and horn; nothing from reckless use or anything. And, the sad thing is; in some of those visits, i couldn't speak in English with my appointed person even though they know English! I try with my little German to bridge the gap. And, i don't see them try the same to help me understand what's wrong with my car. I pay a lot of money, and i deserve to know what's wrong with my car.\n\n4- After one repair in the motor, which cost me the ~2600 Euros, my motor couldn't start the motion of the car smoothly anymore. A friend told me to switch from e10 to e5 benzine. It made things better. But, still i went to BMW because this problem only appeared after they repaired my car. I had the following conversation with them:\n\nMe: my car wouldn't start smoothly with e10 anymore after you repaired my motor. e5 works fine, but not e10\nThey: yeah, e5 is better because blah blah blah...\nMe: but, it's written on the tank opening that the car may use e10\nThey: yeah, that's just for the regulations and law in Germany.\n\nI was speechless. I know the guy must be wrong of course, because it's a serious problem if BMW uses this kinds of tricks. And a big name like BMW wouldn't do that for sure. But, how can I respond to such idiocracy when i hear it?!\nThey told me that nothing is wrong with my car. Later afterwards, even the e5 benzine wouldn't make the start of the motion smooth anymore. The car would kinda jump or hump before it moves; after only 65000 km!\n\n5- As i left the branch one time, i got a feedback form from a person at the counter to rate my experience. I put in a bad feedback about the branch and about her. I asked her where to put the form. She said that she'll take it and pass it on. How on earth would i trust someone I'm complaining against to pass on my feedback to their superiors? Of course, i didn't get any call back from BMW to see why their customer wasn't satisfied.\n\nThat's only from top of my head.

Two of us even took vacation days, and our third friend had just been laid off, so we were all counting on a relaxing, much needed day together. The plan was to ride together and make a whole day of it.\n\nAbout 40 minutes before our appointments, the temporary spa manager called to say they didn’t have enough therapists. They were trying to find someone, but one of us would need to come in immediately for an earlier appointment instead of all three of us going together as scheduled. After scrambling to figure it out, the friend who lived closest drove separately to take the earlier slot.\n\nFrom the beginning, the session felt awkward, clunky, and unprofessional. Even after asking Chris for more pressure, it was so light I joked to myself that a cat could have pressed harder. He stayed in the same spot for so long that I genuinely wondered if my skin was going to be rubbed raw. It was as if he had never been taught, had seen, nor received a massage before. He only moved when I finally asked him to, and each area was the same uncomfortable and ineffective pushing of skin. I even considered stopping the massage altogether, but I kept hoping it would improve with more communication.\n\nWhen it ended, almost abruptly, he simply pointed down the hall and told me to change “down there.” I had to ask someone else for directions. Meanwhile, my friends were in the lounge sipping mimosas and raving about “the best massage of my life,” complete with warm booties and thoughtful parting instructions. I didn’t want to ruin their mood, but they immediately noticed something was wrong. They were upset on my behalf and got a mimosa from the front to cheer me up.\n\nAt checkout, I explained what happened. The receptionist apologized, removed the deep tissue upcharge, and said the manager would contact me that afternoon to offer a massage redo. That call never came.\n\nMonths passed with no followup until today, when I got a text saying they “missed me” and would love to see me again. I couldn’t help but laugh, and decided it was finally time to write this review.\n\nI have used my Google account that does not list my name. If the spa would like to verify that I was actually there, please check your appointment calendar for April 25, 2025 around 9AM.  There were appointments for Melissa, Julia, and Kelsey.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Sweets McGee","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2498,"business_name":"Great Western Arcade","business_type":"retail store","address":"Colmore Row, Birmingham B2 5HU, UK","city":"Birmingham","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0121 233 4126","website":"https://www.greatwesternarcade.co.uk/","google_rating":"4.4","google_reviews_count":1897,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:53:36.763Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2495,"business_name":"Manchester PDSA Pet Wellbeing Centre","business_type":"veterinary clinic","address":"The Montague-Panton Hospital, 50 Redgate Ln, Manchester M12 4RZ, UK","city":"Manchester","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0161 881 0222","website":"https://www.pdsa.org.uk/","google_rating":"4.5","google_reviews_count":1678,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:53:32.872Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2494,"business_name":"GoVets - Manchester","business_type":"veterinary clinic","address":"Unit 1, Varley Industrial Estate, James St, Miles Platting, Manchester M40 8EL, UK","city":"Manchester","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0161 202 1518","website":"https://govets.co.uk/","google_rating":"4.9","google_reviews_count":1959,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:53:32.652Z","worst_review_text":"I took my dog in because he was constantly licking his paw.

Not too long to get into the city by train.\n\nThe room itself was overall terrible. Space was decent but no basic in-room amenities including fridge, kettle or tissue box. The beds were 2 king single beds pushed together and pillows were terrible - I woke up with a sore neck as a result. The worst part of the room was the bathroom. This was room 110 - stay clear of this room unless they renovate the bathroom. Anyone who has stayed in this room would understand. As mentioned in a previous review with photos of the same bathroom, the bathroom is extremely outdated. Feels like a bathroom that belongs in a nursing home/aged care facility. There was also a very musky sewerage smell that was wreaking from the bathroom - basically smelt like urine especially if the door is kept closed.\n\nTo top off this terrible experience, there is no sort of ventilation in room 110 - no fan and no air conditioning. As a result, we needed to leave the window open for air flow. This proved to be a very bad idea. We quickly found out that room 110 is directly above the entrance of this hotel. This meant that we were constantly smelling the waft of cigarette smoke and can hear every single conversation that was being had downstairs. This room was extremely noisy and should be decommissioned until the bathroom is renovated and air conditioning is installed.\n\nWe walked past some other rooms that were directly opposite ours and they looked totally different - renovated, refreshed and welcoming.

Check the interest rates they give you if financing with them, and if financing independent from the dealership ensure that you can get a loan for a branded title vehicle. Some insurance companies and banks/credit unions will not support you for a branded title.\n\nThe \"free delivery\" on the website is only if you are located very far away, I made a 2 hour trip to the dealership and when asked about getting the car shipped they said I didn't live far enough away. So it is free shipping, at their discretion.\n\nWas given a hard time when I asked them to remove bad tint from moisture problems, but eventually they did. Within 24 hours of getting the car, I found out why there were moisture problems; it rained and I had a leak in the rear roof from the taillight above the rear window not being installed  properly. I took it in to get fixed, only to find instead.of installing the light properly they pushed it into place (cracking the light) and used some caulk or putty to seal it. Guess they couldn't fix it the right way. Bumper also wasnt fitted correctly.  I gave up on trying to get help from them since I had to drive 2 hours each way and would need a rental vehicle while they spend an undisclosed amount of time \"fixing\" each issue that popped up. Not even an offer for a loaner vehicle after needing to take it back after already making multiple trips. They felt helpful in the beginning but it became clear they sold me a problem car and would only band aid issues as I mentioned them, I dont know why they couldn't have checked the car for quality prior to sale. I guess the less they have to fix upfront, the easier it is for them.\n\nIts been a couple of months since then, took it to a reputable shop and got most of the problems addressed, including some other minor (but irritable) problems that were found. Overall, the car is fine. Probably wouldn't recommend anyone go here unless you like to gamble! Do your research,  ask questions, and don't buy the same day you look is my advice. Three stars seems fair to me since the Branded Title situation felt sketchy and overall they didnt feel transparent with the condition of the car and providing band aid fixes instead of proper fixes for issues such as the water leak from the poorly installed, and then broken, tail light. Some cars may be in better condition than others and you wouldn't have the same experience as me, just be diligent! If you buy from here I hope it goes smoother than my experience.

lenses wearers be very weary. I was very excited to get new glasses and contacts at a convenient downtown location was very disappointed in the customer service I received. The doctor was excellent and after a very thorough exam, my contact prescription for both eyes was downgraded significantly. When I went to order new contacts from the front desk they did not have them in stock due to my strong prescription and I received a wait time of 3-5 days, which is totally reasonable. I let them know I only have contacts in the wrong prescription and have a new glasses appointment scheduled there for later in the week. Most people know wearing the wrong contact prescription can cause strain on your eyes and severe headaches which I was experiencing. I reached out again hoping I could receive a trial pack of contacts in my correct prescription even if I had to pay extra so that I would not have to deal with intense headaches and eye strain during the work week. Front desk assured me this was not possible and there was nothing they could do for me. Despite my pleas to contact the doctor, I was never allowed to. No other attempts were made to accommodate me. Unfortunately, apathy seems to be the standard now for medical care in the city. I would look elsewhere like Dr. Arick and his caring team at Visualeyes very close by.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Kierra Wing","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2376,"business_name":"Portland Eye Care","business_type":"optician","address":"4133 SE Division St, Portland, OR 97202, USA","city":"Portland","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(503) 444-7639","website":"http://eyepdx.com/","google_rating":"4.9","google_reviews_count":376,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:49:00.784Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2375,"business_name":"The Eye Studio","business_type":"optician","address":"339 NW 9th Ave, Portland, OR 97209, USA","city":"Portland","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(503) 219-0023","website":"http://the-eyestudio.com/","google_rating":"4.9","google_reviews_count":450,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:49:00.566Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2374,"business_name":"Spectacle - NW Portland","business_type":"optician","address":"2250 NW Lovejoy St, Portland, OR 97210, USA","city":"Portland","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(503) 719-5179","website":"https://spectaclepdx.com/book-appointment/","google_rating":"4.9","google_reviews_count":450,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:49:00.344Z","worst_review_text":"Update: After a fourth try to get unscratched lenses, they offered a full refund. The fourth set of lenses were more scratched than the third. While I didn't take the fourth set home, you can see the quality of the third pair in the fifth image. They didn't see the problem with any of them. My original review is below.\n\nThe optometrist was nice and did her job well. If all you need is to get your eyes checked, I can recommend this place. If you need to prescription lenses, I can't yet recommend them. The quality of lenses their manufacturer can produce is unacceptable for their $500 to $600 price (before their %20 first time discount). They are trying one more time to get a good lens, but the rep was dismissive of the scratches that encompassed the surface. The pictures with the green tint/reflection are my 2 year old pair that are far more scratched than when I first got them. Those with a purple tint/reflection are attempts one and two for the new prescription that have a similar to worse amount of scratches and haze as my old pair.

We did not have an appointment, but Jared grabbed the keys and was able to let us test drive the vehicle while he was waiting for an appointment to show. We ended up liking the vehicle enough to move forward with the purchase, which Jared was able to help with. He even mentioned their extended warranty to cover any issues or repairs that the car may need, which we also added at the time of purchase. This interaction was cordial and friendly, we left happy and had a new vehicle.\n\nUnfortunately, these are the last good things I can say about this dealership.\n\nImmediately after purchase, the vehicle threw a check engine light for a faulty thermostat that needed to be replaced. We took the vehicle to a Mazda Dealership as directed by our \"warranty\", only to find that the thermostat repair would not be covered by this program, nor would they cover any of the other service items that the vehicle needed as recommended by the inspection. This caused an additional out of pocket expense that we were not expecting based on the sale of our extended warranty coverage. For an additional $3,000 on top of the purchase price of the vehicle, the expectation was set that repairs would be heavily discounted or paid entirely by this program.\n\nAfter this experience and paying for the repairs out of pocket, we went to attempt to cancel this warranty. This is a process that can only be initiated by the dealer, so we needed to reach out to PDX Motors directly. We contacted PDX Motors to cancel this warranty in writing on 4/9/25. PDX Motors sent the refund for this warranty to our lender on 5/30/25. From the time that the warranty was originally requested to be canceled to the time the refund was issued took nearly 2 months, and countless calls and emails that went unanswered. Had I not have continuously followed up, we may still be waiting. When speaking with the warranty company, they confirmed cancelation on 4/25/25 and confirmed that they issue payment within 5 business days.\n\nLastly, while waiting for this warranty refund to be issued, the vehicle caught fire during a road trip while stopping for gas. The car burned completely to the ground without warning and was a total loss through insurance. While I don't necessarily blame PDX Motors for this, it certainly doesn't inspire buying confidence when coupled with check engine lights and other hidden repairs being needed.\n\nIf you are going to purchase a vehicle from these people, make sure you get an independent inspection. I went against my better judgement, skipped one with this vehicle, and quite literally got burned.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Ryan

a Honda Fit from Santos. So far I am happy with the car I bought. I'm leaving a 2 star review for two reasons. First off, I originally came to look at the Honda Fit that I ended up purchasing. However, Santos suggested another Honda Fit. He was trying to entice me with the paint-job and interior. He didn't suggest a test drive for this one. Red Flag. When I took it for a test drive, it had obvious mechanical issues and it didn't have working AC. ALSO, when we were test driving, he didn't tell me to go on the freeway. On the test drive for the other Fit, he insisted on going on the freeway, but he didn't with this one. And as soon as we hit the freeway, you immediately noticed the mechanical issues. HUGE red flag. It was also a year older than the Fit I was originally looking at, and it had more milage. On top of all of that, it had paint damage, cloudy lights, and very bad rusting under the hood. despite all of these things, BOTH Honda Fits were the same price. I told Santos that I didn't like that he even suggested a car to me that had machanical issues. Santos told me that they 'have a lot of cars on the lot' and said something along the lines of 'he doesn't know every issue with every car'. Okay, but you're suppose to? If you sell me a car, you're supposed to know everything that's wrong with it. Second, after I bought the Fit I ended up going with, the trunk wouldn't open because the lock was broken. They told me to come back and they would fix it for free. I told them to put it in writing and they did. That part was more acceptable. This dealership has better ratings than others in the area, but frankly if you're a buyer and you're reading this, ALL used car lots I've ever dealt with are semi-sketchy, unfortunately. It wasn't really SURPRISING that as a woman who went to a car dealership alone, they would suggest a car that clearly has mechanical issues, expecting me to not test drive it or inspect it at all. If you’re buying a car from these people, you need to fully inspect the car and take it for a long test drive!!!!

She is thorough, professional, has great energy, and explains everything clearly during the exam. I’ve seen her several times and have even referred friends because of the quality of her care.\n\nHowever, my experience during the glasses checkout portion of the visit was disappointing. I’m used to being walked through my insurance benefits, pricing, add-ons, and what is or isn’t covered. Instead, I was immediately asked to pay my copay, and I had to clarify that I was also getting glasses.\n\nThe staff member assisting me wasn’t rude, but she felt checked out and made several assumptions, as if I should already know the process. I gave her polite feedback, and while she was initially defensive, she ultimately listened and apologized. She explained she assumed I knew everything since I’d been there before. I shared that I only come once a year at most, and I still expect to be guided through the standard steps—especially because insurance benefits and pricing change frequently. The interaction ended respectfully.\n\nUnfortunately, as I was leaving, one of the receptionists gave me clear attitude when I said goodbye, signaling she was displeased that I had offered feedback to her coworker. It was uncomfortable and unprofessional. I stepped outside, sat in my car, and debated whether I should let it go or report the behavior. I decided to go back in. As I re-entered, the same receptionist walked out and again gave me attitude, which led me to feel even more frustration. The situation felt unnecessary and unprofessional.\n\nI then asked for contact information for the doctor to formally share my experience, but the staff did not have a clear method for connecting with her. At that moment, the original staff member I had spoken with told me she had actually forgotten to take my measurements, so I needed to sit back down to complete a step that should have been done earlier.\n\nOverall, the exam with Dr. Shah was wonderful, but the checkout and front-desk experience left me feeling uncomfortable and dismissed. I’m sharing this in hopes that it can be addressed so future visits reflect the same professionalism and care that Dr. Shah provides.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Rosie Chavez","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2347,"business_name":"Quality Vision Eyewear","business_type":"optician","address":"2800 S I-35 Frontage Rd #125, Austin, TX 78704, USA","city":"Austin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(512) 462-0001","website":"https://qveyewear.wixsite.com/qveyewear","google_rating":"4.9","google_reviews_count":690,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:48:51.835Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2346,"business_name":"Lone Star Eye","business_type":"optician","address":"7415 Southwest Pkwy Bldg 6 Ste 300, Austin, TX 78735, USA","city":"Austin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(512) 982-9560","website":"https://www.lonestareyecenter.com/?utm_source=gbp&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website_url","google_rating":"4.8","google_reviews_count":717,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:48:51.616Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2345,"business_name":"Austin Optometrists","business_type":"optician","address":"500 E Ben White Blvd d600, Austin, TX 78704, USA","city":"Austin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(512) 912-0920","website":"https://www.austinoptometristspllc.com/","google_rating":"4.4","google_reviews_count":115,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:48:51.396Z","worst_review_text":"Avoid this clinic if possible.

Unfortunately, I could see the screen at work worse with the new computer glasses than with my 13-year-old glasses from before. And that for around 560 Swiss francs. Unbelievable. So I went again (for the 5th time in total, I don't know... or something???), because it can't be true that the new (explicit) computer glasses are worse than my 13-year-old long-sightedness glasses. The boss - I think his name is Mr. Fromberger - had no desire at all to make me glasses that fit. He came straight to me with the reimbursement form and was rather rude to me at first. After a few minutes of consideration—I've actually been wanting to finally get a pair of glasses that fit for almost six weeks and five or six visits to the office—I got the refund form because I didn't want to put up with the boss's rude attitude. Once and never again.

purchased a new Audi S6 Avant e-tron (2025) from the authorized dealer Porsche Graz-Kärntnerstraße. Immediately after delivery, serious defects appeared – in particular, the repeated error message \"High-voltage electrical system: malfunction,\" which prevents the vehicle from starting and the charging ports from opening, as well as the sudden failure of the left digital exterior mirror while driving.\nThese defects pose an acute risk to the health and life of the vehicle's occupants. If the digital mirror suddenly fails while driving, safe maneuvering or reacting to traffic is impossible. The risk of an accident is real.\nDespite several visits to authorized Audi workshops, the defects persist. Furthermore, the service employees cannot specify exactly which problems the planned software updates are actually intended to resolve, which gives the impression of a trial-and-error approach.\nThis approach is unacceptable to me as a customer. With a new vehicle, you expect a functioning and safe product – not an immature experiment.\nI am seriously considering withdrawing from the purchase agreement, but have initially granted a reasonable period of grace. As a customer-friendly solution, I prefer a buyback from Audi AG or, in the worst case, a replacement vehicle without defects.\nUnfortunately, I cannot currently recommend Audi or this dealer. It seems that immature vehicles are deliberately sold – with all the consequences for the end customer.\nMy trust in Audi is currently zero. When switching from another premium brand with three letters, I had significantly higher expectations. Instead of a premium experience, I experienced a rude collision with reality.\nIf anyone is interested in video recordings of the documented defects (also in connection with media publication), I would be happy to provide them upon request.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Petr Hasalík","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2291,"business_name":"Porsche Inter Auto - Graz Kärntnerstraße 234","business_type":"car dealership","address":"Kärntner Str. 234, 8054 Graz, Austria","city":"Graz","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"050 591 144","website":"https://www.porscheinterauto.at/kontakt/porsche-graz-karntnerstrasse-234","google_rating":"4.3","google_reviews_count":248,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:48:33.292Z","worst_review_text":"An appointment was scheduled for a repair and to address other issues.

I ordered two coffees and two cinnamon rolls, expecting something soft and fresh like the cinnamon rolls I usually get in my country or other places I visit as a tourist.\n\nI saw one cinnamon roll on the counter with other cakes, so I assumed we would receive the order right away. No one informed me that I would have to wait 15 minutes for the roll, or that it wasn’t freshly baked but frozen. When it finally arrived, the kids were excited—it looked nice with frosting and some fruit on top. But the moment we took the first bite, we realized it was hard as a rock and very dry—impossible to cut with a fork.\n\nTo me, it felt like a three-day-old pastry that had just been reheated and topped with fresh frosting. I wanted to say something right away, but there was a long queue at the bar. I didn’t want my kids to eat it, but they were too hungry so they ate half of each. When I eventually spoke to the staff, they told me the roll wasn’t old—it had been baked, frozen, and possibly overheated. They offered another cake as compensation, but we didn’t have time and didn’t want anything else to eat after that so we left.\nSince we paid 17 euros for two coffees and two cinnamon rolls, I felt I had to share this experience for future customers. And to the manager and staff: I’m not here to teach you how to handle these situations, but the least you could’ve done was cancel the order and offer a refund.\n\nAlso, let’s be honest: a reheated cinnamon roll can never compare to a freshly baked one. I wonder—have you ever actually tried the cinnamon roll you’re selling for 4.5 euros? If you want to serve it this way, maybe consider half-baking it and finishing it fresh for each order. But most importantly, customers should be informed that it’s not fresh and that it requires time to be reheated.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Anka Nižetić","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2272,"business_name":"Fielmann","business_type":"optician","address":"Europark, Europark Salzburg, Europastraße 1, 5020 Salzburg, Austria","city":"Salzburg","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0662 420835","website":"https://www.fielmann.at/0703","google_rating":"4.5","google_reviews_count":341,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:48:27.462Z","worst_review_text":"Incompetent.

Normally one would put together another table for 3 people having brunch, but since the tables are bolted, it's not the best way to have a meal all together.\nI'm from Italy and when asking if the panino with prosciutto was with a prosciutto like jamon serrano, the reply from the waitress was that it was raw bacon. Not the best wat to explain it.\nThe waitress also sat down at our table at a certain point while taking our order and that was a new thing...\nWe ordered the ham and cheese panino, the dolce vita breakfast, the Sacher, and the tiramisu.\n\nThe tiramisu was too sweet and heavy, the cream was supposed to be more fluffy than what was presented. I also think the fridge it was kept in altered the smell of the tiramisu so it was not the best.\nThe dolce vita meal had a butter Croissant, butter, jam, a chocolate cake with cream and some fruit. The fruit was in a big shot glass and was not a lot and didn't feel super fresh. The single croissant was nice with some added jam but I ended up ordering some bread for the butter and jam as that made more sense.\n\nThe Sacher cake was good but a bit dry and the mam and cheese toast  was warm but the cheese didn't get the time to melt as the slices were still seperate in the cross section of the toast.\nIn conclusion, I feel that a lot of things can be done to make the experience better, I hope there will be more improvements.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Ernesta Mensah","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2259,"business_name":"Café N°5 Salzburg","business_type":"coffee shop","address":"Universitätspl. 15, 5020 Salzburg, Austria","city":"Salzburg","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0660 5257670","website":"http://www.cafeno5-salzburg.at/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":518,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:48:22.793Z","worst_review_text":"We were planning to order, but ended up leaving due to the service.

like the employees here just take one look at you and decide if you can afford a certain brand of Spectacle or no. All my husband asked was how much are those spectacles on the other side of the shop, and the shopkeeper says and i quote “oh that will be too expensive for you”. And all the extra scrutiny only on us when we are going through the products even though there were other customers in the shop. Why? Looks like the employees here prefer catering only to Europeans. News flash - the products you told would be too expensive for us, we can very well afford it and more. Just because some people like to live frugally does not mean they are not well off in life.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"S","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null}]}
