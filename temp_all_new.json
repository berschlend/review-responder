Cool stuff!\n\nUPDATE: 45 days later. Never heard back. Not even an automated text. Shortly after my original review, I went back in person (again) and asked about the status, as well as whether their phone system works. The tech laughed (laughed!) and said, yeah, but sometimes we just get busy and leave it off the hook until things calm down because otherwise it'd just keep ringing. He told me this! Laughing! I'm starting to come around to thinking this place is a brilliant performance art installation. (I moved my prescription and got it filled elsewhere.) Read on if you're truly bored--perhaps on hold--and looking for something to do. Tldr: *Obi Wan voice* these are not the drugs you're looking for.\n\n11/15/25: I just figured the reviews were overwhelmingly negative because most reviews of places like this tend to be negative. It's not like you're going there because things are awesome and them crushing it is usually just them handing you a bottle of pills, you know? My old pharmacy where I used to live had like a 2.3 and I never had issues there in like seven years there.\n\nNope! Wrong. I'm fascinated to talk to anyone who rated this any more than a 1.\n\nIt's just a mess. I've been on hold with them for going on 1:30:00 in the past two days [edit: nope it was 2+ hrs before I gave up tee hee], and it tells you when the number of callers ticks down, so you know that people are being talked to at an appallingly slow rate. Like, if you never heard the count go down, you could think, oh something's wrong with their system. But no, it appears that they've taken roughly 25 minutes to deal with each call in their queue. To me, that's a memorably long call. To them, that's just...average!\n\nThe place feels like where hope goes to die. It's so grim and desolate in there and the people working there shuffle around in s daze as if shellshocked. Like it's huge \"my house burned down around me while I was sleeping so now I'm wearing one slipper and a singed bathrobe holding the door key I saw glinting in a pile of ash and staring into the middle distance\" energy.\n\nWhen I went ELEVEN days ago, they told me they were in the process of filing my prescription RIGHT THEN. (Imagine! It brings me a sort of rueful curdled joy to think of that. To think what could have been.) Just sit there and wait a couple mins, and we'll get it to you, they mumbled listlessly.\n\nThe rest of the story is boring (not as bored as I am right now, and it'd be cathartic, but I don't think boredom is one of those things you're supposed to pay forward). Rest assured, not only did I not get the Rx filled that night, I did not the following Tuesday, nor Wednesday, nor Thursday, nor, it looks like, today.\n\nIf it wasn't putting the quality of my life at significant risk to do so (a hypothetical world, dear reader, I earnestly wish we both lived in), I would just keep the prescription there and document the many shades of gray that color their blithe disinterest in doing the literal atomic least thing to fulfill their responsibility toward me, the customer with a health issue that severely impacts their ability to live a full life. Unfortunately, I cannot, and writing this review for way too long did not eat enough time to actually get me to a human (even if a bored and contemptuous one), so I guess I give up.\n\nWish me a safe weekend, everyone.

While I haven’t sat inside, the vibe seems pretty good too.\n\nHere’s my issue. In the last week I’ve ordered twice and tipped. “Tip the kitchen staff $5 X2”. I ordered onion rings on both orders. Even though I asked if ranch/dipping sauce was included,  I was told it was and it was not. My second order included 10 wings. I was told the order was complete, but there’s no ranch or sauce. This isn’t exactly a big deal.  However it is disappointing. Considering that this wasn’t a mishap. This is apparently the practice for take out. I tipped $10 on a takeout order.

When I was asked inside, they told me I was aggressive, I was not aggressive, I was tense, due to the incident that happened before with the other dentist. I still don't know what went wrong. The fact is, however, I am expelled.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Mark Reijerkerk (mramsnl)","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":6236,"business_name":"Los Lorentes Residences Bern City","business_type":"hotel","address":"Murtenstrasse 147, 3008 Bern, Switzerland","city":"Bern","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"031 552 34 00","website":"http://www.loslorentes.com/","google_rating":"4.1","google_reviews_count":545,"email":"info@loslorentes.com","email_verified":false,"email_source":"pattern_guess","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-18T05:00:23.536Z","worst_review_text":"I booked two rooms and had issues right from the start.

I appreciated this, as I always communicate these clearly due to the severe discomfort I experience if they are not followed.\n\nUnfortunately, the dishes served to me included buffalo mozzarella, fried feta cheese, and undercooked eggs, all of which I would not have expected based on my restrictions. I ate them, trusting that my needs had been taken into account, but not long afterward, I began experiencing severe bloating and pain, to the point I could barely sit still.\n\nI spoke with the waitress during the meal, but was told the chef was too busy to address the issue. I ended up paying 400 CHF (with tip) for a dinner that made me sick.\n\nThis experience was not only disappointing but physically distressing.

The concierge personally made us a dinner reservation while I was standing directly in front of her. I tipped her extra for securing it, given the difficulty of NYE reservations in Basel. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were told we had no reservation. None. Completely nonexistent. There was no apology of substance, no accountability, and no attempt to meaningfully resolve the situation. Just blank stares and confusion.\n\nThe staff overall were detached, unhelpful, and consistently clueless. Not warm. Not anticipatory. Not professional. For a hotel that constantly signals its supposed prestige, the service culture is shockingly weak. There is an air of pretension without any of the competence to back it up.\n\nThey love to mention their Michelin credentials, but let’s be clear. This is not a three-key Michelin experience by any standard. I have stayed at many true Michelin-rated properties around the world. This is not one of them. The gap between what this hotel claims to be and what it actually delivers is vast.\nIt was also my birthday on New Year’s Day. My brother explicitly asked the hotel to arrange a birthday cake. The front desk assured him it would be taken care of. Of course, nothing was done. No cake. No acknowledgment. Nothing. At a supposed five-star hotel, failing at something this basic is inexcusable.\n\nTo make matters worse, when I asked to speak with a manager before departing, no manager ever came. No follow-up. No response. No apology. Silence. That indifference says everything about how this hotel actually treats its guests once payment is secured.\n\nThis place relies on its past reputation, its riverfront location, and its own self-importance. Strip that away and you are left with a poorly run hotel that mistakes arrogance for luxury and branding for service.\n\nI will never return. If you value genuine hospitality, professionalism, and consistency, there are far better options in Switzerland and across Europe. Hotel Les Trois Rois is a masterclass in how to masquerade as elite while delivering mediocrity.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Ty","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":6106,"business_name":"LA

That was fine with me, I just wanted the pain to stop. However, both appointments felt extremely rushed (about 15–25 minutes each). I'm not sure how anyone can properly complete a filling, especially a complicated one in that time. My regular dentist typically takes 35–45 minutes per filling.\n\nThroughout both appointments, Dr. Almohamad barely communicated with me. He didn't fully explain what he was doing, didn't ask questions, and seemed detached and disinterested. When I tried to tell him about my symptoms, he didn't make eye contact or seem to listen.\n\nTruthfully, none of these negative (but ultimately bearable) issues would have mattered if the fillings were done correctly. However, I feel that these oversights and lack of care actually led the dentist to do faulty fillings and to not provide good and honest dental care. Because after this 'complicated' second filling, when the anaesthesia wore off, I was left in severe pain, far worse than before treatment.\n\nThat night, I experienced unbearable, electric-shock-like pain shooting through my jaw and head. I've had many fillings over the years due to my bad teeth, but I've never left a dentist's office feeling worse than when I arrived.\n\nI called the practice the next day and asked to see another dentist because I didn't want to return to Dr. Almohamad. Thankfully, another dentist (Dr. Kefallinou) saw me instead and she was much kinder, empathetic, and professional. She explained that the filling had been left too high and hadn’t been properly adjusted for my bite, which was causing the nerve pain. She smoothed it down, which helped for a short while.\n\nUnfortunately, a few weeks later the pain returned - my face was feeling numb on the side of the fillings, I had incredible nerve pain and sensitivity beyond anything I've felt so far. When I finally saw my regular dentist, they found that the \"complicated\" filling had actually cracked the tooth, was too thick, and hadn't been sealed properly. I now have to have both fillings redone, but thankfully, no root canal is needed after all.\n\nWhile the reception staff and other dentist at this practice were polite and helpful, my experience with Dr. Almohamad was genuinely awful. Both in terms of care and result.

What is the purpose of a checkup if we should know already if there is something wrong? It’s the dentist's responsibility during checkup to see if there is something wrong. When I said this to the dentist, I’ve heard that \"he sees thousands of patients with chipped teeth and he can’t notice them all\" 🤣 that \"he will no longer fix my tooth\", and that I should \"find myself a new place to go to\". You do not want a sloppy and arrogant dentist who blames you for his mistakes instead of fixing them!\n\nI was already weary of this dentist's bad reputation as my friend also had a bad experience. This dentist placed a very unfit filling and as a result my friend got a crack in this tooth. Your teeth pay the price for dentist's mess so choose a less sloppy dentist.\n\nSecond, TPA is a factory and the service terrible. They seem to schedule clients with 0 minutes in between. If you are 5 minutes late because of traffic, you are yelled at by the dentist (!) His time is precious, your time is not.

I wait some time to make this decision to put my experience out. Was  really traumatic experience\n\nIn my case, there were repeated organizational failures – the assistant forgot to schedule my appointment twice. When I finally came in, I was not taken in for treatment but only for a consultation. The dentist informed me that my 12-year-old root canal treatment supposedly had a massive infection, even though I have no pain or any symptoms at all. I was told that I needed to act immediately and was referred to a specialized clinic in Amsterdam Oost.\n\nAfter contacting this clinic by email, I was told that the treatment would cost approximately €2,200–3,000 and require 4–7 visits. This seemed excessive, so I sought a second opinion at Lassus Tandartsen and also at another clinic in Germany. Both clinics confirmed that what may appear as an infection on an X-ray can also be something else, and that it is not possible to make such a serious diagnosis based on an X-ray alone. The entire situation felt highly unprofessional and borderline fraudulent.\n\nDespite my experience, my husband later went back to Dental365 for treatment. Unfortunately, due to a serious medical error, material was left inside his tooth, which led to a severe infection. As a result, he lost the tooth and suffered extreme pain, to the point where his condition became very serious.\n\nWhen we started addressing the issue with Dental365 and a lawyer, the clinic later contacted us to inform us that we had been overcharged and that they needed to refund €150 due to their own mistake. This only further confirms the lack of professionalism.\n\nAt Lassus Tandartsen, we were assured that they would support us in court if necessary, as the loss of the tooth and the subsequent complications were clearly the dentist’s fault.\n\nHonestly, if my husband had a heart condition, this situation could have been fatal.\n\nOur experience with Dental365 has been shocking. My husband is from Amsterdam, and I have lived here for 14 years, so we know how healthcare normally functions in the Netherlands — and this was far below any acceptable standard.\n\nI cannot recommend this clinic to anyone","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Eva Korosova","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":6042,"business_name":"Lassus Dentists","business_type":"dental office","address":"Keizersgracht 132, 1015 CW Amsterdam, Netherlands","city":"Amsterdam","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"020 471 3137","website":"https://www.lassustandartsen.nl/?utm_source=local&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gmb","google_rating":"4.3","google_reviews_count":848,"email":"info@lassus.nl","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-18T01:00:25.519Z","worst_review_text":"I don’t know the name of the rude woman who picked up the phone yesterday (September 22, 2025) at 12:48pm from Lassusstraat 9 when I called about an inquiry to a surprise invoice of EUR 180, for a service that I did not schedule - basically got charged a paradontology clean up when I scheduled a regular one (and honestly cannot tell at all how different the cleaning I got was from the other regular cleaning visits where I paid EUR 25 !).

When we arrived, I asked for the price, hoping for a better deal than online. She offered what seemed like a great price, but only for one double room, despite me clearly requesting two single rooms. I double-checked after feeling that the price was too good to be true(she already made me made the payment), and she played innocent, claiming I had asked for one room. Exhausted after a long journey, I had no choice but to pay for an extra double room, which made the total much higher than the online rate.\n\nWhen we complained about the inflated prices, she changed the price on the computer right in front of us, treating us like we were stupid and wouldn’t notice. Despite her polite appearance, I could sense deep hostility in her attitude.\n\nShe then promised us “good rooms,” but one had zero privacy, with a window facing directly onto a neighbour’s balcony, which was extremely close. The room she labeled as “good” was far from it.\n\nOn the third day, the same staff member accused me of not paying the previous day’s city tax, even though I had already paid. She raised her voice, embarrassing me in front of other guests. I had to show my bank transaction to prove it, and even then, she offered no apology, just gave me a fake smile:\"alright, you can go now.\"\n\nAs a PhD student in Canada, I have no trouble communicating in English, so this was definitely not a language issue. I can’t help but wonder if we were treated this way because we are Asian.

A review is feedback, not a fight. It’s how restaurants learn what’s working and what isn’t. I noticed some responses from the restaurant to other reviews here felt more defensive than curious, especially when multiple people mention similar issues (like bland food).\n\nI’m leaving it because people deserve to know what they’re paying for, just as restaurants deserve honest feedback that helps them improve. I also wished you would have asked for my feedback when my plate was taken half full from the table…\n\nFor the price you pay at Trattoria Antichi Sapori, this was the most unsatisfactory value meal I’ve ever experienced. $60 for a white truffle pasta that was so bland, I could hardly ate the half of it.\n\nI ordered two dishes with truffle (an appetizer and a white truffle pasta). Both were so bland I kept checking whether I had suddenly lost my taste buds. No salt, no pepper, no depth, no flavor, even the truffle couldn’t rescue it. That’s some talent there by itself. lol\n\nSeveral of us at the table felt the food was very bland, and we even had to add salt and pepper just to bring out some flavor.\n\nThe only bright spot was our server, I believed he was the owner at the same time. He was very kind and friendly, but there were only two people working the floor, so we barely saw him. After we finished eating, my half untouched meal sat there for around 1.5 hours in front of me until only then it was grabbed in hurry.\n\nThe dessert (dark chocolate) was actually the best thing we ordered.\n\nWe saw this restaurant featured in a newspaper, and honestly, it created expectations the food did not meet at all. Maybe they had a better day when the journalist visited, I just know our experience was nowhere near what was promised.\n\nI also noticed that several other reviews mention the same thing about the food being bland. When multiple guests share similar feedback, it usually means there’s something worth improving. I truly hope the kitchen takes that to heart, because the atmosphere and our lovely host deserves food that matches their energy.\n\nAnd on a positive note, if one day you feel you’ve worked on these flavors and would like to host us to share an honest feedback, I’d be happy to return with an open mind. A great experience deserves to be shared just as much as a disappointing one.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Ful Den","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5998,"business_name":"Miake Izakaya Basel","business_type":"restaurant","address":"Sempacherstrasse 7, 4053 Basel, Switzerland","city":"Basel","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"061 311 13 13","website":"http://www.miake.ch/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":744,"email":"info@miake.ch","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-18T01:00:12.512Z","worst_review_text":"I’ve been wanting to dine here for quite some time and had even messaged them previously to enquire, but unfortunately never received a reply.

However, the lunch experience itself was a bit underwhelming. They offered only three set menus, with no option to order à la carte, and the content felt rather meagre for the price.

Even more disappointing, however, was that the flowers were already wilted the next day.\n\nWhen I politely asked the store today why this might have happened, an employee rudely told me that it was my fault because I hadn't cut the flowers. Perhaps I should have known that fresh flowers should be cut – but I expect a specialty store to actively advise customers of this rather than blaming them after the fact.\n\nA younger employee in the store was very understanding and even offered to give me new flowers. But her supposed boss immediately blocked my offer – a shame, because she certainly could have handled the situation in a more customer-friendly manner.\n\nOverall, I'm disappointed by the lack of friendliness and the poor service. Next time, I'd rather take the slightly longer route and go to Blumen Hajny on Museumstraße, where customers are still valued.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Daniel Ritzberger","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5988,"business_name":"Brigitta Spelthuis","business_type":"florist","address":"Blumen und Lifestyle Im Arkadenhof, Maria-Theresien-Straße 34, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria","city":"Innsbruck","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0699 18125234","website":"http://www.blumen-lifestyle.com/","google_rating":"4.4","google_reviews_count":21,"email":"brigitta.spelthuis@gmail.com","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-18T01:00:09.394Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5987,"business_name":"Blumenfee Karin","business_type":"florist","address":"Fürstenweg 148, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria","city":"Innsbruck","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0664 2346500","website":null,"google_rating":"5.0","google_reviews_count":9,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-18T01:00:09.130Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5986,"business_name":"Blumen Calovini","business_type":"florist","address":"Amraser-See-Straße 56a, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria","city":"Innsbruck","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0512 325430","website":"http://www.blumen-calovini.at/","google_rating":"4.0","google_reviews_count":46,"email":"blumen@calovini.at","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-18T01:00:08.866Z","worst_review_text":"I arrive at the store today at 6:30 p.m. I ask if they have any red roses.

there for a weekend and had a very bad experience. Two hours after the checkout, my husband received an invoice charging us 50 euro for \"equipment rental\". When we question then about it, they alleged to be due to a portable hair dryer missing. However the only hair dryer we saw in the room was in the toilet and attached to the wall. Luckily we were still in the city and walked back to the hotel to solve this in person (our luggage were also storaged at the hotel). Talking with the lady in the front office, she tried to convince us, with a smirking on her face, that there were no hair dryer attached in the restroom. This cannot be true as we were there, we saw that. We asked if they wanted to check out our luggage and bags and she said this were not necessary, although she talked in german in front of us (assuming that we don't understand German because we communicate all the time in English) to another colleague that \"those are the guests who took the hairdryer\" and that would call the manager, said manager that never talked with us or even apologized for the terrible experience. In the end, she agreed to refund but the money is still on hold.\n\nOther considerations:\nI have to say that the staff were nice most of the time. However we found problem when needed anything from them, e.g. we asked for slippers thrice and did not get it. Only on the 4th time, when we went directly to the reception and waited there for that.\n\nWe had breakfast only once because we thought the fridge with the stick saying \"vegan\" were filled with vegan food and it was not, was full of \"normal cheese\" misleading us into taking some of it but being vegan for so long now we asked the staff the only replied \"is normal cheese so we keep it cold\". So, if you are vegan or lactose intolerant, be careful and double check the products in there. They do have vegan options but it is not \"wide range of vegan options\" as they stated in their webpage. You can find fruits, breads, potato chips, jams, and a type of sausage spread. Also plant based milk and alpro dessert.\n\nThe bed was uncomfortable. It felt like a bunch of stacked cartoons.\n\nRooms seemed clean at first sight but there were what I suppose to be pubic hair around the bath.\n\nLocation was very nice.

It felt like they’re trying to squeeze every cent they can out of guests, which leaves a bad impression.\n\nThe location is convenient for getting around, but the surroundings aren’t the nicest.

I went in to see Dr Chan but this time it wasn't him it was what I could only assume was a student filling in for him. My visit wasn't for glasses but for a infected eye that has a inner stye. The So called Optometrist that was there sat me down spent almost the entire time with his attention drawn to the computer didnt listen to my story that lead up to the event that caused my stye and acted the whole time like I was taking up his time. I explained in detail and non of it was of any interest to him just handed me a referral and said my eye had a stroke and no medication was needed no antibiotics nothing  just go home and wait for your appointment on the 18th and see what they say. I should have known something was wrong because when I got there for my 1115 am appointment there were 4 other patients in front of me and he saw all of them in in under 30 minutes as they were getting exams. This review isn't on Dr Chan but this individual that was in charge that day. Even the online Doctors said he should have prescribed me some kind of antibiotics for the infection and pain and advised me for home remedies like warm compress to help until my appointment but he did not just said nothing needed. I could have done better just going to the ER. I am very disappointed that I went that day just to see a student who couldn't help me no wonder he didn't prescribed me anything he may not have the requirements to do so.

The place felt depressing and cheap despite the high price. Absolutely no attention to guest comfort. If you value your money, your sleep, or your mood, avoid this place completely.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Adelina Zait","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5900,"business_name":"Gasthaus Babenbergerhof","business_type":"hotel","address":"Babenbergerstraße 39, 8020 Graz, Austria","city":"Graz","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0681 81942448","website":"http://www.info-graz.at/babenbergerhof-graz-jazz-volksmusik-gasthaus-jam-session-musikstammtisch-jazzstammtisch/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":84,"email":"info@info-graz.at","email_verified":false,"email_source":"pattern_guess","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-17T22:00:54.170Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5889,"business_name":"NED Hotel","business_type":"hotel","address":"Triesterstraße 439, 8055 Graz, Austria","city":"Graz","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0316 291357","website":"https://nedhotel.at/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":291,"email":"office@nedhotelgraz.com","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-17T22:00:51.109Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5882,"business_name":"S'Kloane Brauhaus","business_type":"restaurant","address":"Schallmooser Hauptstraße 27, 5020 Salzburg, Austria","city":"Salzburg","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0699 81310739","website":"https://www.der-kastner.at/","google_rating":"4.6","google_reviews_count":1051,"email":"info@der-kastner.at","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-17T22:00:48.708Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5879,"business_name":"L'Osteria Salzburg","business_type":"restaurant","address":"Dreifaltigkeitsgasse 10, 5020 Salzburg, Austria","city":"Salzburg","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0662 87065810","website":"http://www.losteria.at/","google_rating":"4.0","google_reviews_count":9664,"email":"info@losteria.at","email_verified":false,"email_source":"pattern_guess","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-17T22:00:47.893Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5832,"business_name":"Naumann Optik Inh.

customer-focused at all.\nTo get an eye test, you're required to choose a frame beforehand, even though it's not even clear whether your prescription has changed.\nThe fact that some customers get an eye test and then go elsewhere with their prescriptions is certainly the reason they tie the eye test to a pair of glasses.\nHowever, I don't understand why, as an existing customer who has bought almost 10 pairs of glasses there, I can't have my prescription checked and adjusted accordingly.\nAdd to that the rude tone of the employee—no thanks!!!\nBoth I and my family will be buying our

There's one right next to the bathroom and that's all visible one. I found one plug was behind the bed which was impossible to use as it was too close to the bed frame, yes I can move the bunkbed and use it but good luck with moving the bed around when other person is sleeping on the bed as well.

Guests waited for hours with no clear information, no access to restrooms (room cards were required), and no basic hospitality such as water or coffee. By early evening, the lobby looked like an emergency shelter, with families preparing to sleep on sofas.\nThe following morning, breakfast was overcrowded and poorly planned. Only a few proper tables and seating were provided, many guests had to use those mini lobby tables and sofas. Families, and elderly guests could not eat comfortably. I personally had to eat sitting on the floor. At this price level, this is unacceptable.\nTo make matters worse, we also did not receive the room type we paid for. One of our children is sixteen years old and counts as an adult, yet one of the booked double rooms had only a single bed. This resulted in three adults and one seven-year-old child sharing only three sleeping places.\nOur request to have the rooms next to each other, or at least on the same floor, was rejected abruptly and without courtesy.\n\nStaff appeared overwhelmed and powerless. No apologies were offered at check-in, during the stay, or at check-out.\nThis hotel clearly sells more rooms than its facilities and staff can handle. When occupancy is high, service collapses. That is a management issue, not bad luck.\nI would not stay here again and cannot recommend this hotel.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Antal Igaz","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5797,"business_name":"B&B HOTEL Graz City-Süd","business_type":"hotel","address":"Gmeinstraße 8, 8055 Graz, Austria","city":"Graz","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"01 9284258","website":"https://www.hotel-bb.com/de/hotel/graz-city-sued","google_rating":"4.4","google_reviews_count":1356,"email":"info@hotel-bb.com","email_verified":false,"email_source":"pattern_guess","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-17T21:00:27.244Z","worst_review_text":"We had booked two rooms on 2nd of January 2026 but one of them had a really bad smell.

We sent the following email to management the same evening after our experience and received no reply:\n\nWe had a 5:30pm reservation this evening. We were the second table seated in our room. An amuse bouche came at 6:18, followed by the first course at 7:42pm. Waiting more than two hours for our actual meal to start is unacceptable, particularly since other tables received their first courses before us. We had told the waitstaff shortly after sitting that we needed to leave at 8:15 to make our 9pm train. I believe she did her best but there must have been an issue with the kitchen. The table next to us left in frustration. We kept hoping the meal would arrive. Finally at 8:05, we told our waitress that we really must leave, so the kitchen packed up the remaining food. I have attached pictures of what it looked like. Somehow it included 2 servings of courses we had already eaten and 3 main dishes with meat. No vegetarian meal.\n\nIn addition, although we requested gluten free and the server confirmed we had ordered gluten free, we never received it. Our daughter was served bread and ravioli, the same as the rest of us. However, it was clear the waitstaff was overwhelmed, and so we just did the best we could with what we received. It was supposed to be an enjoyable Christmas meal, but instead we felt hungry and stressed out as we ran to meet our train.\n\nI discussed the situation briefly with the manager and received a 200 euro discount before we left, but I would have continued the discussion if I had the time. The meal and drinks were certainly not worth the nearly 600 euro we ended up paying.\n\n—-\nI have attached pictures of all the food we received except for the amuse bouche. The food that was packaged was inedible, especially the dessert. They wrapped up napkins with the cake and it all became one big mushy mess.\n\nUpdate: In response to the restaurant’s message… we selected the 4 course meal, and we were at the restaurant for 2 hours and 45 minutes. In that time, we only received 2 out of 4 courses. No one offered our daughter gluten free options for the bread or ravioli. They were simply placed in front of her by frazzled waitstaff.\n\nI do understand that packaging our food was an extra support for our predicament. However it should not have been necessary to do that in the first place. Our 4 course meal began nearly 2 hours and 15 minutes after we sat down, which is simply crazy.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Sarah

Why do restaurant place the rudest person at the front desk??? I experienced the folks taking care of the people with reservations to be very rude. I got there early and they're were NO one there in the dining area. They wanted to sit me in between a column. I asked could I sit at a table with a view since they're is no one there?   The maitre'd said no cause all 2-chairs tables were reserved for 6:30 and 7. No problem that is why we are here early and only wanted apps and a drink. Nope!

Before getting your knickers in a wad just know I have experience in retail from clerk staff on up to management. I realize the popularity of online grocery pickup and I use it myself. However I’ve noticed in the last six months or some of the staff who fill these orders walk around the store pushing their carts and taking up most of the aisle without making any acknowledgment or even a cursory apology if they’re blocking an item you are shopping for. Many of them have ear buds in their ears and seem oblivious to customers standing right next to them. The politeness and professionalism is lacking to say the least. On the plus side the folks who check the receipts are extremely polite and friendly so maybe there’s a trade-off there.

The female pharmacist have been doing well with working with me on my prescription. April 22, 24, there was a man who was operating the front store when I called to check front store hours that had hung up the phone. I called later to confirm front store hours and a lady picked up and I told her what happened and she told me what time they closed. They close at 8pm and I arrived at 7:43pm. When I arrived the man who worked the front store was standing outside the store and I didn't feel safe going in but I needed to get an over the counter prescription my nurse suggested I get. So I went in and there's nearly 15 minutes until closing so I go get the over the counter medication; the man turns on and off the light when I come to front of store and the woman comes out.\nI check out and go outside the man is back outside standing in front of store but I wanted to use a coupon on my receipt for the purchase, so go in to do so and ask the lady if she works there due to the item being a female item. I talk to the lady about returning the purchase and using the coupon and she goes on to talk as though it was something wrong with the request and said, \"I can do it but you just purchased this and technically we're not supposed to do that.\" I say I'm not sure why you're saying there's anything wrong with using this coupon I just got I'm not aware about this store and coupons how that is anything wrong, she says sorry and I grabbed my items and recipt and left.  I called another pharmacy and they did handle the return and allowed me to use the coupon, which was nice and the pharmacist also looked up why I wasn't receiving my prescription from my pharmacy, I feel they performed great customer service.

We booked a double and were given a twin and at check in told that they only clean rooms every 4 days so we wouldn't get any housekeeping. Im ok with the principal of asking for this on a city break but they only provided 1 towel per person- do they really expect you to go 4 days showering when you have been out in a city each day with 1 towel?!\nThe room was ridiculously hot- we were told heating is centrally controlled and all rooms were that hot, we couldn't change room and the best thing we could do is \"open a window\". For context on how hot it was, we had 3 windows open overnight and I still woke up dehydrated with a sore head and neither of us slept with any covers. We were told air conditioning in the hotel doesn't work.\nWe were asked if we wanted the twin to be made a double and despite the 5 reminders we gave them, we stayed 3 nights with twin beds.\nWe asked for fresh towels and they never came, eventually it became \"self service\" where reception could only give me 1 towel.\nWe were on the 6th floor and the elevator broke which was brilliant when trailing luggage downstairs!\nThere are 2 entrances to get to the hotel- from Mariahilfer you have to fo through a dark passage where there can be homeless people- i would not recommend this to lone

A young lady, a pharmacy tech behind the counter that appeared of the Indian origin, with a long hear in her pony tail, called another lady by her name, who was behind me in the line, to come to the counter to pick up her meds. They two new each other privately. After the customer was done I asked the tech, when is my turn to get her help and her name. She refused to give me her name.

I hope they'll replace it. If there's no shower gel... then at least give  a good shampoo to your guests. There's no kettle, coffee, or tea in the room; you can get some at reception, but you can't take drinks into your room. Since the hotel is full of elderly people, you won't get any tea, and there might not be a place to sit and drink tea. Breakfast is a real disappointment.\nPs. Even if its 3 stars ...I think guests still expect good service. It's no longer a luxury for hotels to have a kettle, even just for the winter, or cotton swabs for cleaning ears...these are basic hygiene needs...Shampoo combination 2 in 1 ( 20ml) for hair and whole body...great combo. But if even a hostel has this, and a 3-star hotel doesn't, then call yourself a Guest House for uninvited guests.
