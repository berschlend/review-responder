## OPTION 1: Hotel (Default - bereits auf Demo-Page)

### Negative Review (1-Stern)
```
Worst hotel stay ever. Room was dirty, staff was incredibly rude when I asked for help, and the AC didn't work at all. I couldn't sleep because of the heat. Avoid this place at all costs!
```

**Business:** The Godfrey Hotel Hollywood
**Rating:** 3.4 Stars (1,096 reviews)

## OPTION 2: Restaurant

### Negative Review (1-Stern)
```
Terrible experience. Waited 45 minutes for cold food, server forgot our order twice, and the manager was dismissive when I complained. The pasta was overcooked and bland. Save your money and go somewhere else.

## OPTION 3: Zahnarzt/Arztpraxis

### Negative Review (2-Stern)
```
Very unprofessional. Waited over an hour past my appointment time, staff seemed disorganized, and the dentist rushed through the exam. Felt like just another number. Won't be returning.
```

## OPTION 4: Auto-Werkstatt

### Negative Review (1-Stern)
```
Complete rip-off! They charged me $800 for repairs that should have cost $300. When I questioned it, they got defensive. Found out later the "new" parts were refurbished. Do NOT trust this place.
```

## OPTION 5: Friseursalon

### Negative Review (1-Stern)
```
Asked for a trim and left looking like a disaster. The stylist clearly wasn't listening to what I wanted. Manager offered no refund, just a "sorry." Took months to grow out. Absolutely devastating.
```

---

## OPTION 6: E-Commerce/Amazon Seller

### Negative Review (1-Stern)
```
Product arrived broken and two weeks late. Customer service was useless - they just kept sending automated responses. Still waiting for my refund after 3 weeks. Worst online shopping experience ever.
```
