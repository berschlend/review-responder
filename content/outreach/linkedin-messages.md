## FOLLOW-UP MESSAGES (After Connection Accepted)

### Follow-up 1: Immediate Value (Send within 24h)
```
Thanks for connecting, {name}!

Quick question - do you currently respond to all your Google/Yelp reviews?

Most businesses I talk to either:
A) Spend 30+ min/day on reviews
B) Skip responding entirely (hurting their reputation)

We built ReviewResponder to solve this - AI generates perfect responses in seconds.

Would a 2-min demo be helpful? Here's a quick example:

No pressure - just thought it might save you time!
```

### Follow-up 2: Case Study Approach
```
Hey {name}, hope you're doing well!

Wanted to share something that might interest you:

A {industry} business we work with was spending 5+ hours/week on review responses. Now they do it in under 30 minutes - and their response rate went from 40% to 100%.

The secret? AI-generated responses that sound human and match their brand voice.

Curious if this could help {company}? Happy to show you how it works!
```

### Follow-up 3: Free Trial Offer
```

1. Paste any review
2. Pick a tone (Professional/Friendly/Apologetic)
3. Get a perfect response in seconds

```

### Follow-up 4: Problem Awareness
```
{name}, quick thought for you:

88% of consumers read reviews before buying. But here's the kicker - they also read HOW businesses respond.

A thoughtful response to a negative review can actually turn it into a positive impression.

The challenge? Writing good responses takes time and skill.

That's why we built ReviewResponder - AI does the heavy lifting, you just approve.

Want to see it in action? Takes 60 seconds.
```

### Follow-up 5: FOMO / Limited Offer
```
