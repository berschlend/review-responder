## Sequenz A: Restaurant Owners

### Email 1 (Tag 1) - Der Eisbrecher

**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- `Your 1-star reviews are costing you $8,200/year`
- `Quick question about [Restaurant Name]`
- `Saw your reviews on Google...`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

I was looking at {{RESTAURANT_NAME}} on Google Maps and noticed you have
some reviews that haven't been responded to yet.

Studies show that 45% of diners are more likely to visit a restaurant
that responds to reviews - even the negative ones.

But I get it - you're busy running a kitchen, managing staff, and
keeping customers happy. Who has time to write thoughtful responses?

That's exactly why I built ReviewResponder. It uses AI to write
professional, personalized responses in 10 seconds - in any language.

Would you like to try it free for 14 days? No credit card needed.

Reply YES and I'll set you up.

Best,
Berend

P.S. Here's a response we generated for a similar restaurant:
"Thank you for dining with us, Maria! We're thrilled you enjoyed our
homemade pasta. Our chef puts his heart into every dish. We hope to
welcome you back soon for our new seasonal menu!"
```

### Email 2 (Tag 4) - Social Proof

**Subject Lines:**
- `How Mario's Trattoria saves 5 hours/week`
- `Re: Your Google reviews`
- `Quick follow-up`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

Just wanted to follow up on my last email about responding to your
Google reviews.

I know running {{RESTAURANT_NAME}} keeps you busy, so here's the
short version:

- 10 seconds per review response (vs. 5-10 minutes manually)
- AI matches your restaurant's tone and personality
- Works in 50+ languages (great for tourist areas)
- 50% launch discount with code EARLY50

One restaurant owner told me: "I used to spend Sunday evenings
answering reviews. Now I spend it with my family."

Still interested in that free trial?

Reply YES - takes 30 seconds to set up.

Best,
Berend

### Email 3 (Tag 8) - Urgency & Value

**Subject Lines:**
- `Last chance: 50% off ends Friday`
- `[Restaurant Name] - one more thing`
- `Did you see this?`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

Quick update - our 50% launch discount (code: EARLY50) expires this
Friday. After that, it's full price.

I wanted to make sure you didn't miss out, especially since
{{RESTAURANT_NAME}} could really benefit from faster review responses.

Here's what you'd get:

STARTER ($14.50/mo with discount):
- 100 AI responses/month
- 4 tone options (Professional, Friendly, Formal, Apologetic)
- Response history

That's less than the cost of one dessert on your menu.

Reply YES for your free 14-day trial, no card needed.

Best,
Berend

P.S. Even if you don't choose us, please start responding to your
reviews. It genuinely helps your business. I'm happy to share some
templates if you'd prefer to do it manually.

### Email 4 (Tag 14) - Break-up Email

**Subject Lines:**
- `Should I close your file?`
- `Goodbye?`
- `One last thing before I go`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

I've reached out a few times about helping {{RESTAURANT_NAME}} with
review responses, but haven't heard back.

No worries at all - I know you're busy, and maybe this isn't the
right time.

I'm going to close your file, but wanted to leave you with this:

A Harvard Business School study found that a 1-star increase in Yelp
rating leads to a 5-9% increase in revenue.

Responding to reviews is one of the easiest ways to boost that rating.

If you ever want to try ReviewResponder in the future, the door is
always open. Just reply to this email.

Wishing you and {{RESTAURANT_NAME}} all the best!

Berend

P.S. If you're handling reviews manually, here's a tip: Start with
just the negative ones. A thoughtful response to criticism shows
future customers you care.
```

## Sequenz B: Hotel Managers

### Email 1 (Tag 1) - Der Eisbrecher

**Subject Lines:**
- `Your TripAdvisor reviews need attention`
- `Quick question about [Hotel Name]`
- `89% of travelers read review responses`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

As the {{JOB_TITLE}} at {{HOTEL_NAME}}, you probably know that
89% of travelers read management responses before booking.

I was looking at your property on TripAdvisor and noticed some
reviews could use a response.

Here's the challenge: Writing thoughtful, personalized responses
takes 10-15 minutes each. With dozens of reviews coming in, that's
a full-time job.

ReviewResponder solves this. Our AI generates professional,
brand-appropriate responses in 10 seconds. In any language.

Want to see how it works? Reply YES for a free 14-day trial.

Best,
Berend

P.S. Sample response we generated for a boutique hotel:
"Dear Mr. Thompson, thank you for choosing Grand Hotel for your
anniversary celebration. We're delighted that our spa services
exceeded your expectations. Your kind words about Maria at the
front desk have been shared with her team. We look forward to
welcoming you back for another special occasion."
```

### Email 2 (Tag 4) - ROI Focus

**Subject Lines:**
- `The hidden cost of unanswered reviews`
- `Re: {{HOTEL_NAME}} review responses`
- `Quick math for you`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

Let me share some quick math:

Average hotel booking: $150/night
Guests lost due to poor review management: 2-3/week
Annual revenue lost: $15,600 - $23,400

Now compare that to ReviewResponder:

Professional plan: $49/month ($588/year)
Time saved: 10+ hours/month
ROI: 26x - 40x return

One hotel GM told me: "Our review response rate went from 30% to
95% in the first month. Our booking inquiries increased by 12%."

The 50% launch discount (code: EARLY50) makes this a no-brainer:
- Starter: $14.50/month
- Professional: $24.50/month
- Unlimited: $49.50/month

Reply YES - I'll set you up with a free trial today.

Best,
Berend
```

### Email 3 (Tag 8) - Multilingual Angle

**Subject Lines:**
- `German, French, Spanish, Japanese... covered`
- `Your international guests deserve a response`
- `Quick question about [Hotel Name]`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

I noticed {{HOTEL_NAME}} gets reviews in multiple languages.

One of the trickiest parts of review management for hotels is
responding in the guest's native language. Google Translate works,
but it often sounds robotic and impersonal.

ReviewResponder detects the review language and responds naturally:

- German review → Perfect German response
- Japanese review → Polite Japanese response
- French review → Elegant French response

All while maintaining your hotel's voice and professionalism.

We support 50+ languages out of the box.

Want to try it? Reply YES for your free trial.

Best,
Berend

P.S. Our Pro plan ($24.50/mo with EARLY50) also includes:
- Review Analytics Dashboard
- Bulk response generation (20 reviews at once)
- Team accounts (add your front desk staff)
```

### Email 4 (Tag 14) - Break-up Email

**Subject Lines:**
- `Closing your file`
- `Last email from me`
- `Before I go...`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

This is my last email about ReviewResponder.

I completely understand if the timing isn't right or if you've
found another solution.

Before I go, here's a free tip that might help:

Create a "Review Response Template Library" with 10-15 templates
for common scenarios:
- Great stay, will return
- Minor complaint, fixable issue
- Major complaint, compensation offered
- Business traveler feedback
- Family vacation feedback

It won't be as fast as AI, but it'll help your team respond
consistently.

If you ever want to try ReviewResponder, just reply to this email.
I'll personally set you up.

Wishing {{HOTEL_NAME}} a successful season!

Best,
Berend

## Sequenz C: Local Service Businesses

*(Plumbers, Electricians, Dentists, Lawyers, Salons, etc.)*

### Email 1 (Tag 1) - Der Eisbrecher

**Subject Lines:**
- `Your Google reviews are your new business card`
- `Quick question about [Business Name]`
- `93% of customers check reviews first`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

As a {{BUSINESS_TYPE}} owner, you know that word-of-mouth is
everything. But did you know that 93% of customers now check
online reviews before calling?

I was looking at {{BUSINESS_NAME}} on Google and noticed you
have some great reviews - but many don't have responses yet.

Here's why that matters: Responding to reviews (especially
positive ones!) shows potential customers you're engaged and
professional.

The problem? Writing thoughtful responses takes time you don't
have.

ReviewResponder is an AI tool that writes professional responses
in 10 seconds. Perfect for busy business owners.

Want to try it free for 14 days? Reply YES.

Best,
Berend

P.S. Here's a sample response for a plumbing business:
"Thank you so much for your kind words, Jennifer! We're glad we
could fix your water heater emergency quickly. Your recommendation
means the world to us. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything
else - we're always here to help!"
```

### Email 2 (Tag 4) - Time Savings

**Subject Lines:**
- `Reclaim 3 hours this week`
- `Re: Your Google reviews`
- `Quick follow-up`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

Quick follow-up on my last email.

I know running {{BUSINESS_NAME}} keeps you on the road (or in the
office) all day. The last thing you want to do at 8 PM is answer
Google reviews.

But here's the thing: Those reviews are probably your #1 source of
new customers. And responding makes a huge difference.

With ReviewResponder:
- 10 seconds per response (not 5-10 minutes)
- Do it from your phone between jobs
- AI matches your friendly, professional tone
- Works in any language

Starter plan is just $14.50/month with code EARLY50.
That's less than one service call.

Reply YES to start your free trial.

Best,
Berend

### Email 3 (Tag 8) - Competitor Angle

**Subject Lines:**
- `Your competitors are responding...`
- `Quick thought about [Business Name]`
- `Noticed something interesting`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

I looked at some other {{BUSINESS_TYPE}} businesses in your area.

Here's what I found: The ones ranking higher on Google Maps are
responding to almost every review. The ones ranking lower? Radio
silence.

Google's algorithm favors businesses that engage with customers.
It's one of the easiest ranking factors to improve.

{{BUSINESS_NAME}} has great reviews. Imagine if every one had a
thoughtful response from you.

ReviewResponder makes this possible in minutes, not hours.

Our 50% launch discount ends soon:
- Starter: $14.50/mo (100 responses)
- Professional: $24.50/mo (300 responses + analytics)

Reply YES - I'll set you up today.

Best,
Berend
```

### Email 4 (Tag 14) - Break-up Email

**Subject Lines:**
- `Should I stop emailing?`
- `Last one from me`
- `Quick goodbye`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

I've reached out a few times about helping {{BUSINESS_NAME}} with
review responses. Since I haven't heard back, I'll assume the
timing isn't right.

No hard feelings at all! I know you're busy serving customers.

Here's a parting tip: Even if you don't use a tool like ours, try
to respond to at least your 5-star reviews. A simple "Thank you,
[Name]! We appreciate your business." goes a long way.

If you ever want to try ReviewResponder, just reply to this email.
I'll personally set you up with a free trial.

Wishing you and {{BUSINESS_NAME}} continued success!

Best,
Berend

P.S. One last stat: Businesses that respond to reviews see an
average rating increase of 0.3 stars. That's meaningful!
```
