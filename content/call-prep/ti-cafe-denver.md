## Opener Script (Wort für Wort)

**[Klingelt...]**

> "Hi, is this the owner of Tí Cafe?"

**[Wenn ja:]**

> "Hey! This is Berend from ReviewResponder. You clicked on our demo yesterday - I wanted to quickly check if you got to try it? It takes just 30 seconds to see how AI responds to your reviews."

**[Wenn "no time":]**

> "Totally understand - just 2 quick questions: Do you respond to your Google reviews yourself? And do negative ones take a lot of time to answer?"

---

## Hook Script

> "I noticed your cafe has some great reviews but also a few tough ones. Our AI writes professional responses in 5 seconds - most cafe owners save 2-3 hours per week. Want me to show you with one of your actual reviews?"

## Objection Handling

| Einwand | Antwort |
|---------|---------|
| "I'm too busy right now" | "Totally get it - can I call you back tomorrow? What time works better for you?" |
| "We already respond to reviews" | "Great! How long does a negative review response take you? Our AI does it in 5 seconds. Want to see a quick demo?" |
| "We don't get many reviews" | "Actually that's even more reason - when you DO get one, especially a negative, you want to respond fast and professionally." |
| "How much does it cost?" | "20 responses are completely free. After that, it's $29/month for 300 responses. But try it free first!" |
| "I'll check it out later" | "I can send you a one-click link right now - takes 30 seconds to see it work. Can I send it to this number or your email?" |

## Kontext

- **Warum guter Lead:** Personal Gmail address = likely owner, not corporate chain
- **Clicked yesterday:** Hot timing - still has ReviewResponder in mind
- **Vietnamese Cafe:** Small business, owner-operated, reviews matter a lot
- **Denver Market:** Competitive food scene, reputation is crucial

## Beispiel AI-Antwort (zum Vorlesen)

**Review (3 Sterne):**
> "Food was good but service was really slow. Waited 25 minutes for our pho."

**AI Response:**
> "Thank you for visiting Tí Cafe! We're glad you enjoyed the food. You're right - 25 minutes is too long for pho, and we apologize for the wait. We've been busier than expected lately, but that's no excuse. We're working on streamlining our kitchen process. We'd love to make it up to you - please ask for me next time and I'll personally make sure you're served quickly. Hope to see you again!"
