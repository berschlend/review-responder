It was a disappointing reminder of why I hadn’t purchased from a dealership in 8 years.\n\nThe car I chose had a sticker price of $23,777. After taxes and “document fees,” the salesman presented me a written quote of $26,267—the higher end of my $28,000 budget, but still manageable. Confident in the purchase, I even went ahead and bought insurance for the car.\n\nThat’s when the circus began. We arrived at 4:00 p.m. and were kept waiting for hours. Not called back until 7:45 p.m., nearly an hour after closing, exhausted and ready to sign. And that’s exactly what they were banking on.\n\nWhen the finance manager finally slid the paperwork across the desk, my pen was literally on the page when I noticed the numbers. That $26,000 “deal”? Suddenly it had ballooned to over $30,000. No explanation. No disclosure. Just “sign here.”\n\nAnd why? Because they had quietly tacked on thousands in worthless warranties and add-ons I never asked for. Things no one bothered to explain—just slipped in, hoping I’d be too tired or too trusting to notice. The only comments I heard were, “oh, we have a warranty on it” and “we’ll throw in the gap on us!” Throw in? No—sneak in.\n\nWhen I called out this deceit, the manager insisted he’d given me a “great deal.” In what world does a $23,000 car magically becoming a $30,000 purchase qualify as a deal? To make matters worse, when I said no one told me the price increase, he brushed it off with, “I told you what the monthly payments would be.” As if anyone would assume a $26,000 quote somehow meant a $30,000 loan.\n\nThis dealership didn’t just lose a sale—they proved exactly why people hate buying cars.

They provided me the refund link with wrong details 4 times before I finally got my refund.\n\nDuring the test drive, we noticed the car was pulling to the left. We immediately raised this with the salesperson, it was noted in the paperwork, and we were assured it would be fixed before collection. we even phoned Cargiant before pickup to double check, and they confirmed the issue had been resolved.\n\nHowever, when we collected the car, it still had the exact same fault. Despite promising they would only release the car to customer once it was fixed and safe to drive, they knowingly handed us a faulty vehicle. The very next morning, we emailed them again to report the problem.\n\nFrom there, aftercare has been appalling. When we reported the fault, we were told to take the car to KwikFit. However, when KwikFit tried to contact Cargiant for authorisation, their calls were not answered. We even had to phone Cargiant ourselves and hand the phone to the KwikFit mechanic, only for them to later confirm that they could not identify fault. We then tried four different garages, including the ones recommended by Cargiant and none were able to diagnose the issue.\n\nWhen we asked Cargiant to handle the repair directly, the earliest appointment they offered was over a month away, and when we asked how long the repair would take, they did not give us an estimate. We also requested a courtesy car to cover the period without a vehicle, but this was refused. We then asked if they would cover our expenses for repeated drop-offs and pick-ups, which they also refused. Finally, we asked if they could collect and return the car themselves to save us further inconvenience, and again they refused.\n\nMeanwhile, we rely on this car for work and daily needs. The amount of time, stress, and inconvenience this caused has been giant, all because Cargiant released a faulty and unsafe car instead of ensuring it was properly repaired.\n\nAs a last resort, we asked to return the vehicle. They gave us a appointment date two weeks later. When we went to drop it off yesterday, staff had no idea we were there to return the car, they thought we were booked in for fault inspection. We had to show them the email confirmation proving we were there to return the car.\n\nYesterday, we’ve dropped the car off and now waiting for their “internal inspection”. If they do not handle this fairly and promptly, we are prepared to take legal action and report them to the relevant authorities, including Trading Standards and The Motor Ombudsman.\n\nWe will keep this review updated. After this experience, We cannot recommend Cargiant. Once the sale is done, their support is dismissive, unhelpful, and completely fails to take accountability for selling a faulty car.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Muneeb Ahmed","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":4267,"business_name":"Showcase Flowers","business_type":"florist","address":"325 Mason St, San Francisco, CA 94102, USA","city":"San Francisco","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(415) 771-8323","website":"http://www.showcaseflowers.com/","google_rating":"4.1","google_reviews_count":50,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T02:00:48.654Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":4252,"business_name":"UF Health Jacksonville Pharmacy","business_type":"pharmacy","address":"855 8th St W, Jacksonville, FL 32209, USA","city":"Jacksonville","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(904) 244-3333","website":"https://ufhealthjax.org/pharmacy","google_rating":"2.9","google_reviews_count":39,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T02:00:43.904Z","worst_review_text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE TODAY picking up my Rx refill.

Husband never had an issue with picking up my med for me but today I get the wrong person. I prepaid she it didn't show that I did so I paid again. She said my ID info wasn’t in the EMR so she had to re-enter my drivers license info in again? The medication requires cold packing, and has  always previously been done but not today. I asked for the cold packing and she responded “I’ll have to find someone to do that” while clearly annoyed. She then STILL placed my medication into a brown paper bag to give to me. I again, stated it needed to be cold packed at which time I asked for a manager. UF Health has had an unfavorable  reputation with regard to patient experiences and it appears work still needs to be done to improve in this area. I waited and a woman “Julie “ approached the window to speak to me. I asked if she was the manager but she stated she was the pharmacist for the day. Either the manager didn’t care to speak to me or they didn’t let him or her know there was a customer requesting them. I was not surprised and went on to relay my experience to Julie who listened but I must mention gave me the clear impression my complaint probably would go anywhere. I left but had to regrettably go back inside to get a receipt for my FSA records. The gentleman who provided my receipt was the same one who iced and gave me my medication earlier. I wish I had gotten his name because he was the only employee displaying any sense of an interaction in line with positive patient experiences. I have ALL my other prescriptions filled at a retail pharmacy but the one I picked up today regretably HAS to be filled at UF Health’s pharmacy due to their employee medical insurance plan.

For the last 6 months, I have had to deal with continual grief in getting my prescriptions refilled and in getting new prescriptions filled.  Three months ago, I called the automated phone number for refills of my prescriptions to be picked up at the Satellite Pharmacy pick up window and was given a day when they would be available for pickup.  I went to the Satellite Pharmacy on that date, sat in my car for over 2 hours in line and once I got to the window, was informed they had one of the four prescriptions I called in, but didn't have the others.  I ended up going to the main hospital pharmacy to get the snafu fixed and my medications filled.  To activate new prescriptions, you have to go onto the Genesis patient portal, which is a nightmare in itself as you have to change your password every 60 days.  This normally would not be an issue, but you have to pick a password that doesn't utilize any of the same letters or characters used in the last 50 or so passwords used.  Anyway, I had managed to do this and indicated that I needed to activate my new prescriptions and wanted them sent to the Satellite Pharmacy pick up window, which was verified by the pharmacy technician via message on the Genesis patient portal.  Now today, I waited in my car in line for over 2 hours only to be told I had to go inside the building to pick up my medications via a pharmacy kiosk!  I went inside and then left after seeing a line of over 30 people waiting to pick up their medications!  If you try to speak to anybody about this they just give you a stupid look and tell you there isn't anything that can be done about it!  This is a travesty, as our active duty, veterans and their families deserve better treatment!  This is an example of socialized medicine at its worse!
