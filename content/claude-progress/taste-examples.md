## ❌ SCHRECKLICHE RESPONSES (NIEMALS!)

our top priority and we strive to provide exceptional service."

- Kein spezifischer Bezug zum Review
```

It means the WORLD to us! Can't wait to see you again! 😊🎉"

WHY WRONG:
- Emojis
- "THRILLED", "WORLD" (übertrieben)
- Caps Lock
- Keine Substanz
```

### Defensive bei Kritik
```
❌ WRONG:
"We're sorry you had that experience. Please note that
we were extremely busy that evening and our staff was
doing their best. We hope you'll give us another chance."

WHY WRONG:
- Entschuldigung ohne Action
- Defensive Ausrede ("extremely busy")
