## Bot Filter Analysis

**Problem Found & Fixed:**
- `filterSequentialClicks()` marked 3+ clicks/min as bot
- This caught email security scanners BUT ALSO real users!
- **FIX:** Burst filter DISABLED, only user-agent detection now

**Current Filters:**
- Bot email patterns (scanner domains)
- User-agent detection (Go-http-client, python-requests)

**Result:** 39 raw clicks → 37 real clicks (5.1% fake)
