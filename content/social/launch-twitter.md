🚀 It's happening!

ReviewResponder is now LIVE on @ProductHunt!

We built an AI tool that generates professional review responses in seconds.

No more spending hours crafting replies to customer reviews.

The problem:

Every business owner knows responding to reviews is important.
- Better SEO
- More customer trust
- Higher conversion rates

But who has time to write thoughtful, unique responses every day?

We sure didn't. So we built ReviewResponder.
```

How it works:

1. Paste the review
2. Select your tone (Professional, Friendly, Formal, or Apologetic)
3. Click generate
4. Copy & paste your perfect response

That's it. 10 seconds instead of 10 minutes.
