## Post 1: Main Launch Announcement

```
🚀 Big news: ReviewResponder is now LIVE on Product Hunt!

After months of development, we're excited to share our AI-powered review response tool with the world.

The Problem We're Solving:
Every business owner knows they should respond to customer reviews. It improves SEO, builds trust, and shows customers you care. But crafting thoughtful, unique responses takes time - time most entrepreneurs don't have.

Our Solution:
ReviewResponder uses AI to generate professional, personalized responses in seconds. Just paste the review, select your tone, and you're done.

Key Features:
• AI-powered responses using GPT-4o-mini
• 4 response tones: Professional, Friendly, Formal, Apologetic
• Any language (auto-detect)
• Chrome Extension for Google Maps
• Business context for personalized responses

🎁 Launch Day Special: 60% OFF with code HUNTLAUNCH (24 hours only!)

If this sounds useful for your business, I'd really appreciate your support on Product Hunt today:

## Bonus: Pre-Launch Teaser (1 Day Before)

```
🔜 Tomorrow is the big day!

After months of building, we're launching ReviewResponder on Product Hunt.

What is it?
An AI-powered tool that helps businesses respond to customer reviews in seconds.

Why we built it:
I was tired of spending 20+ minutes per day crafting review responses. Multiply that by hundreds of businesses - that's millions of hours wasted on a task that AI can do better.

What to expect tomorrow:
• Full product demo
• Exclusive launch discount (60% OFF!)
• Chrome Extension for Google Maps
• Lots of caffeine on my end ☕

If you're free tomorrow around 9 AM CET, I'd really appreciate your support on Product Hunt.

I'll share the link here as soon as we're live!
