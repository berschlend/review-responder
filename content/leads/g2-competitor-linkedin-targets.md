Hi [Name],

I saw your G2 review about Birdeye - the daily bugs and slow support sound frustrating.

We built ReviewResponder specifically for people in your situation. No complex platform. No bugs. Just AI that writes professional review responses in seconds.

Here's a free demo: https://tryreviewresponder.com

Would love to hear if it solves what Birdeye couldn't.

Cheers,
Berend

Hi Robert,

Saw your G2 review about Podium - those lock-in contracts are brutal. As a fellow small business person, I get it.

ReviewResponder is the opposite: no contracts, no complex platform, just simple AI review responses. Cancel anytime.

No salespeople, no lock-in, promise.
