Since the dealership is about 100 miles away, I asked about transportation options. The representative I spoke with, Amanda, offered to check with management to see if a complimentary pickup was possible and would get back to me by the end of the day. I did not receive a return call.\n\nOver the next several days, I left multiple messages and made follow-up calls. When I reached her again, she did not remember our previous conversation at first, and after I refreshed her memory, she said the vehicle was too old for a courtesy pickup. I then asked for a quote for a paid pickup service. She told me she would speak with management and call me back that day. Again, I received no call.\n\nI made one more attempt and left another message, but as of today, I still have not received a return call.\n\nI am disappointed with the lack of follow-through and communication, especially given the expectations that typically accompany the Rolls-Royce name. I hope the dealership will review this experience and improve responsiveness for future customers.\n\nUpdate December 8, 2025:\n\nI received a follow-up call from the service manager after posting my review, and I appreciate that he took the time to reach out. He explained that the department had been short-staffed due to his attendance at a manufacturer conference.\n\nOn my initial call, Amanda did mention that she needed to speak with management before giving me an answer, and I appreciated that transparency. The concern was not that she needed guidance; it was that she assured me she would call back the same day, and no call ever came. After several additional attempts on my part, I still received no follow-up.\n\nWhile I appreciate the courtesy of the manager’s call, the explanation did not fully resolve the underlying issue. Even if short-staffed, a quick message acknowledging the delay or letting me know a decision would have to wait until management returned would have set clear expectations. Instead, the lack of communication over several days made the process more difficult than it needed to be.\n\nThe follow-up call did confirm that the challenge was not simply workload but a breakdown in communication and follow-through. I hope this feedback helps the department strengthen those areas going forward.\n\nAt this time, I believe my original rating remains accurate based on the full experience.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Rob S.","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5110,"business_name":"blumen company","business_type":"florist","address":"Rumfordstraße 43, 80469 München, Germany","city":"München","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"089 29161055","website":"http://www.blumencompany.de/","google_rating":"5.0","google_reviews_count":10,"email":"info@blumencompany.de","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T22:00:51.142Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5092,"business_name":"Premier Pharmacy","business_type":"pharmacy","address":"4900 Oak St, Berlin, OH 44610, USA","city":"Berlin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(330) 893-0290","website":"http://www.premierpharmacy.net/","google_rating":"4.9","google_reviews_count":16,"email":"j-gause@premierpharmacy.net","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T22:00:45.839Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":5072,"business_name":"OPTICA DUBLIN","business_type":"optician","address":"6 Dawson St, Dublin 2, D02 E763, Ireland","city":"Dublin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(01) 677 4705","website":"http://www.opticadublin.com/","google_rating":"3.5","google_reviews_count":82,"email":"info@optica.ie","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T22:00:39.907Z","worst_review_text":"Never have I ever been treated with such arrogance and conceit as a customer.

Secondly considering the abysmal price tag you would think the customer service would be amazing. Well you would be wrong. The girls at the reception got my name and surname wrong on the invoice and then when i emailed them about it i never got a reply. When i was choosing the frames downstairs nobody helped me. And usually opticians are supposed to help you choose the right frame that sit on your nose correctly and don’t feel tight. None of that happened either. I chose the frames myself and they sent me on my way, nobody asked any questions at all. I feel like they were all a bit lackluster when it came to customer service (let me remind you the cost was 320 eur). So i will never come back and don’t advise you to. My husband went to Specsavers dundrum (not sure about any other location) and he got two pairs of glasses for the same price as me and their customer service was so much better.

When I arrived to view the car, Jahid only offered a quick test drive around the car park, and I had to insist on a proper road test. During the viewing, it also became clear that Jahid did not appear to know much about this specific car when I asked him questions, and he seemed more interested in taking personal calls while I was trying to sort the paperwork with him. The vehicle itself was faultless and accurately described.\n\nI proceeded with a finance agreement and a £1700 RAC Platinum warranty, although the terms and conditions were not fully explained to me at the time. I decided to cancel the warranty less than a week after purchasing the car. The sales manager, James, initially said he didn’t know how to process a cancellation and claimed no customer had ever asked before. He later said he did know, and that the refund would take 7–10 days.\n\nI have since seen online that my warranty policy has been cancelled, yet no refund has been issued by Cargem. Despite multiple messages, emails, and phone calls, I’ve been completely ignored by the sales staff and still have not received any acknowledgement or explanation.\n\nThis level of customer service is completely unacceptable.

I get my truck back from the shop and I took all the fender flares off because they were all falling off anyways.

However, I think criticism may better help the restaurant. Let me explain.\n\nI moved to the area about a year ago and walked by Mason's Grille. Place was busy, smelled amazing. My wife and I enjoyed the food and we would recommend this place to all our friends and family. So let's establish that I am not a complete hater of this restaurant.\n\nWe went yesterday evening for dinner and this was my honest experience.\n\n- There's a strange smell the the dinning area.\n- Service is always great.\n- Soups and bread are great.\n- Caesar Salad seemed dry and lacking of cheese. The presentation almost looked like a bag of Wegmans romaine lettuce without any dressing and a few pieces of grilled chicken slices.\n- Mac and Cheese Lobster - watered down cheese sauce and too garlicky + a small portion of lobster. This was not worth $33.\n-Seafood Norfolk - oh boy. When I had this a year ago, it was amazing. The fish was so bland, tasteless, no seasoning. I'm guessing the seafood was frozen and thawed out in the oven.\n- Bloody Mary and chocolate martini - Excellent.\n- Mason's perfect pomegranate - fruit flies in our drink. Yummy.\n\nOverall if I can recap this review. I'm not a professional critic. I'm just a guy that travels a lot in the states, eats different foods and watch a lot of nightmare kitchen. This place, in my opinion use to be great. I can tell, over the year that they are cutting corners in food quality and portion.

This time, someone new was at the counter.\n\nFirst she insisted that my e-prescription (same provider as last dozen times) was not valid because I \"opened it\". I explained to her that what I have is a summary of my prescription, that I cannot open or send around my prescription but my provider has sent it to the pharmacy.\n\nI understand the confusion considering that it is a EU-wide e-prescription, but not created in the template as local German prescriptions. But the provider is certified for telemedicine in Germany, valid and has been processed by the same pharmacy about a dozen times in the last couple years.\n\nShe did, after explanation, process it. I thought that this was the end of our interaction. But this person, who has talked to me only 3 sentences in her lifetime, gave me a scolding about how I should go to a gynocologist or I could get cancer.\n\nI told her I do go a gyno regularly. She then told me to then get a prescription from my gyno directly instead of my provider.\n\nAgain, without knowing anything about me, my situation, my reason for needing a prescription, my insurance type... Scolded me then proceeded to tell me to change my provider.\n\nThe reason I have the provider I have is because my current gyno does not offer any telemedicine services and I am frequently out of the country. It is difficult to quickly find doctors you can trust with availability, covered by my insurance and without linguistic barriers. My telemedical provider checks all these boxes and still acts according to the decisions of my gynocologist.\n\nRegardless, I have taken her advice, partially.

I’d be delighted to have it all sorted in one place, but the offer was „too safe”.\n\nLast, but not least, hence I didn’t buy frames from them, and got mine elsewhere, they „forgot” to send me the survey that was supposed to arrive within 10 or so days.\nI guess your feedback is not that important if you don’t spend few hundred with them (and my aim was to get quality, good looking and long-lasting frames, which I did, just not with them).","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Aga Brady","ai_response_draft":"That's completely unacceptable - five visits for glasses that still don't fit properly after spending €460.

After more delay and side chats and support to other colleagues, I got sorted. I still got charged 10 extra eur for an eye test extra although I booked myself for a simple basic vision test which in their website they quote as free.

At the end, I was told the problem was caused by “leaving a headlight or another light on overnight.” This was the same explanation I had previously been given for issues with another vehicle, and it felt like an easy way of shifting the blame onto the customer rather than addressing the actual fault.\n\nAfter nearly a week in their care, I collected the car — only for the exact same problem to return just three weeks later. I booked another appointment for 11/09/25 and carefully explained that the issue had not been resolved the first time. This time, Mr. Aston was assigned to me.\n\nAs I live in Farnham (GU9), arranging drop-off and collection is already very inconvenient around my work schedule. Despite this, I received no updates until I called the following day. Mr. Aston informed me the vehicle had been “fixed” — but when I asked what had been repaired, he said they had resolved a tyre pressure warning. I was extremely frustrated, as I had made it very clear that my concern was with the braking and headlight system faults, not a tyre pressure alert.\n\nWhen I again explained the real issue, I was reassured it would now be addressed properly. I also requested several times to speak with the Service Manager, but was repeatedly told he was “busy.” To this day, the Service Manager has not had the courtesy to return my call.\n\nConsidering I purchased this vehicle from Toyota for around £44,000, I expected far better after-sales service. Toyota proudly advertise a 10-year / 100,000-mile warranty, but my experience shows that the level of support provided tells a very different story.\n\nMy main reason for writing this review is to highlight to other customers that when you buy a vehicle, it’s not only the car you are purchasing — it’s also the standard of service you will receive afterwards. Sadly, in my experience, Curry Motors Kingston has fallen far short of the level of care and professionalism Toyota customers should be able to rely on.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"FARNHAM DRIVING SCHOOL","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":4530,"business_name":"Hallmarque","business_type":"car dealership","address":"Michelin House, 81 Fulham Rd., London SW3 6RD, UK","city":"London","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"07904 555774","website":"https://hallmarque.co.uk/","google_rating":"5.0","google_reviews_count":58,"email":"info@hallmarque.co.uk","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T17:10:11.170Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":4529,"business_name":"Clive Sutton - Luxury Car Dealer UK","business_type":"car dealership","address":"151b Park Rd, London NW8 7HT, UK","city":"London","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"020 7483 6500","website":"http://www.clivesutton.co.uk/","google_rating":"4.8","google_reviews_count":79,"email":"info@clivesutton.co.uk","email_verified":false,"email_source":"pattern_guess","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T17:10:10.845Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":4528,"business_name":"Balham Cars London Ltd","business_type":"car dealership","address":"306 Balham High Rd, Tooting Bec, London SW17 7AA, UK","city":"London","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"020 8672 2100","website":"http://www.balhamcarslimited.com/","google_rating":"4.4","google_reviews_count":288,"email":"sales@balhamcarslimited.com","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T17:10:10.571Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":4527,"business_name":"H.R.

It was a disappointing reminder of why I hadn’t purchased from a dealership in 8 years.\n\nThe car I chose had a sticker price of $23,777. After taxes and “document fees,” the salesman presented me a written quote of $26,267—the higher end of my $28,000 budget, but still manageable. Confident in the purchase, I even went ahead and bought insurance for the car.\n\nThat’s when the circus began. We arrived at 4:00 p.m. and were kept waiting for hours. Not called back until 7:45 p.m., nearly an hour after closing, exhausted and ready to sign. And that’s exactly what they were banking on.\n\nWhen the finance manager finally slid the paperwork across the desk, my pen was literally on the page when I noticed the numbers. That $26,000 “deal”? Suddenly it had ballooned to over $30,000. No explanation. No disclosure. Just “sign here.”\n\nAnd why? Because they had quietly tacked on thousands in worthless warranties and add-ons I never asked for. Things no one bothered to explain—just slipped in, hoping I’d be too tired or too trusting to notice. The only comments I heard were, “oh, we have a warranty on it” and “we’ll throw in the gap on us!” Throw in? No—sneak in.\n\nWhen I called out this deceit, the manager insisted he’d given me a “great deal.” In what world does a $23,000 car magically becoming a $30,000 purchase qualify as a deal? To make matters worse, when I said no one told me the price increase, he brushed it off with, “I told you what the monthly payments would be.” As if anyone would assume a $26,000 quote somehow meant a $30,000 loan.\n\nThis dealership didn’t just lose a sale—they proved exactly why people hate buying cars. If you value your money, your sanity, and your dignity, stay far, far away.\nShame on you.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"bailey buckman","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":4513,"business_name":"Cargiant","business_type":"car dealership","address":"44-45 Hythe Rd, London NW10 6RS, UK","city":"London","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"020 8969 5511","website":"http://www.cargiant.co.uk/","google_rating":"3.9","google_reviews_count":10100,"email":"support@cargiant.co.uk","email_verified":false,"email_source":"website_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T17:10:05.855Z","worst_review_text":"The worst and most stressful car buying experiences I’ve ever had.\n\nUpdate: The car was finally returned but after much stress, dealing with unfriendly customer service and I wasn't fully compensated for my financial loss. They provided me the refund link with wrong details 4 times before I finally got my refund.\n\nDuring the test drive, we noticed the car was pulling to the left. We immediately raised this with the salesperson, it was noted in the paperwork, and we were assured it would be fixed before collection. we even phoned Cargiant before pickup to double check, and they confirmed the issue had been resolved.\n\nHowever, when we collected the car, it still had the exact same fault. Despite promising they would only release the car to customer once it was fixed and safe to drive, they knowingly handed us a faulty vehicle. The very next morning, we emailed them again to report the problem.\n\nFrom there, aftercare has been appalling. When we reported the fault, we were told to take the car to KwikFit. However, when KwikFit tried to contact Cargiant for authorisation, their calls were not answered. We even had to phone Cargiant ourselves and hand the phone to the KwikFit mechanic, only for them to later confirm that they could not identify fault. We then tried four different garages, including the ones recommended by Cargiant and none were able to diagnose the issue.\n\nWhen we asked Cargiant to handle the repair directly, the earliest appointment they offered was over a month away, and when we asked how long the repair would take, they did not give us an estimate. We also requested a courtesy car to cover the period without a vehicle, but this was refused. We then asked if they would cover our expenses for repeated drop-offs and pick-ups, which they also refused. Finally, we asked if they could collect and return the car themselves to save us further inconvenience, and again they refused.\n\nMeanwhile, we rely on this car for work and daily needs. The amount of time, stress, and inconvenience this caused has been giant, all because Cargiant released a faulty and unsafe car instead of ensuring it was properly repaired.\n\nAs a last resort, we asked to return the vehicle.

For the last 6 months, I have had to deal with continual grief in getting my prescriptions refilled and in getting new prescriptions filled.  Three months ago, I called the automated phone number for refills of my prescriptions to be picked up at the Satellite Pharmacy pick up window and was given a day when they would be available for pickup.  I went to the Satellite Pharmacy on that date, sat in my car for over 2 hours in line and once I got to the window, was informed they had one of the four prescriptions I called in, but didn't have the others.  I ended up going to the main hospital pharmacy to get the snafu fixed and my medications filled.  To activate new prescriptions, you have to go onto the Genesis patient portal, which is a nightmare in itself as you have to change your password every 60 days.  This normally would not be an issue, but you have to pick a password that doesn't utilize any of the same letters or characters used in the last 50 or so passwords used.  Anyway, I had managed to do this and indicated that I needed to activate my new prescriptions and wanted them sent to the Satellite Pharmacy pick up window, which was verified by the pharmacy technician via message on the Genesis patient portal.  Now today, I waited in my car in line for over 2 hours only to be told I had to go inside the building to pick up my medications via a pharmacy kiosk!  I went inside and then left after seeing a line of over 30 people waiting to pick up their medications!  If you try to speak to anybody about this they just give you a stupid look and tell you there isn't anything that can be done about it!  This is a travesty, as our active duty, veterans and their families deserve better treatment!  This is an example of socialized medicine at its worse!

The crab claws were tough, had very little meat, and ultimately didn't have flavor that stood out. The fish was entirely unseasoned and over-fried. The hushpuppies are marketed as containing crab, cheese curd, and jalapeno. We concluded that the only way they could've really gotten this description was from an AI model trying to get people to order the dish. A more apt name would have been bread and butter hushpuppies. They contained none of what was advertised, but would be great for anyone looking for fried dough served on top of butter. I commend this restaurant for being able to earn such great margins on their food, and they are a testament to the fact that great location is all it takes to survive as a business.

We were celebrating a birthday and the staff surprised us with complimentary celebratory drinks, which was a really thoughtful touch and much appreciated.\n\nService overall was friendly, but the pacing of the meal was definitely off. We were sitting there for a while without food while other tables who sat after us started getting theirs. Our server came by to check in and realized we hadn’t gotten anything besides drinks, so she ended up comping our sourdough. It was a nice gesture, but it definitely felt like our table got overlooked early in the night.\n\nFood-wise, things were hit or miss. We shared 3 small plates (burrata, sourdough, and hamachi crudo), 2 pastas (gnocchi and bucatini), and 2 proteins (king salmon and duck breast). Burrata didn’t come with bread, which surprised us, and while the sourdough was very good, the burrata itself didn’t land for me. The plum sauce and radish made it overly sweet and not very balanced.\n\nThe king salmon was the biggest miss. It was a very small portion for $53 and ended up being overcooked and kind of boring. The duck breast was a little better, but still didn’t have much flavor on its own. The side veggies with both proteins were actually the highlight.\n\nPastas were fine, but nothing memorable. The bucatini didn’t have a center hole, so it just felt like a thicker pasta. Gnocchi was decent but not standout.\n\nWith drinks, tax, and a mandatory 22% service charge, the total came out to over $500 for four people. When pastas are $30+ and mains are $50+, it’s hard not to expect something a little more polished. We had a good time and the setting is nice, but the food just didn’t feel worth the price. Overall, this was the most expensive yet most disappointing and forgettable meal we had in Seattle.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Martin

Love the car; my experience at the dealership - not so much.  I checked the car out in person and then went back and forth with the sales guy a few times over text before we agreed on a price.  He gives me a price, and I tell him we had a deal and I was coming down to sign.  When I got there, I was told that it was a typo, and the price was $1000 more.  (In fairness, the sales guy had tried texting and calling when he realized his error).\n\nThey come down a bit when I gripe, but it wasn't the number we agreed upon in text.  He shows me the numbers on paper, but when the salesguy took out his calculator to show how the numbers worked out, the numbers were wrong and he had to get a new printout.  I once again felt like I was being played.\n\nAfter filling out initial forms, I'm then waiting for an hour for the finance guy.  End of year; I get that.  But no one checks in with me and I'm just sitting there wondering if they were playing me.\n\nI finally meet with the finance guy, and he tries to imply that I need to buy a bunch of maintenance plans, making me wonder if I made a mistake in choosing the vehicle I was purchasing.  I know it's his job to upsell, but after seeing the numbers change so often, I was feeling extra uneasy.\n\nFinally two hours after I had gotten to the dealership to sign, the sales guy brings my car up and hands me the key.  I ask what the paper plate was doing in the car.  He said most people don't want people drilling their front plate.  I told him when I got an actual license plate, I'd need one, so I prefer it now.  He said I'd have to come back in a few days and then he'd be happy to put the front license plate holder on.  (I didn't understand the reasoning).\n\nHe then walks away without asking if I had questions (i had a few).  I ended up sitting in the parking lot for a few minutes before I felt comfortable driving to leave.  All in all, it made me have buyer's remorse buying the car, which was very unfortunate.\n\nI reached out to the general manager the next day explaining why I thought the experience was overall unpleasant.  He said to come in the next day, and they'd put in my front license plate holder and answer questions I had.  (By that time, I had learned what I needed to online).  He had promised to meet with me in person and wanted to ensure I left feeling good about my experience, but I never saw him.\n\nI cannot recommend buying from Stevens Creek Hyundai.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Bryan Lee","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":3804,"business_name":"Capitol Chevrolet","business_type":"car dealership","address":"905 Capitol Expressway Auto Mall, San Jose, CA 95136, USA","city":"San Jose","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(408) 622-1851","website":"https://www.capitolchevysj.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=googlemybusiness","google_rating":"4.3","google_reviews_count":2505,"email":"info@capitolchevysj.com","email_verified":false,"email_source":"pattern_guess","contact_name":null,"status":"contacted","source":"night_blast","created_at":"2026-01-16T01:00:04.016Z","worst_review_text":"NEVER LEASE FROM THEM if you don’t like thousands in surprise bills after returning the car.\n\nI had leased a 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV from them and had purchased the excess wear protection plan they offered at the time.

The dealer told them that a crack in windshield (worth $700+) was not covered by the protection plan (Fine print in the policy mentioned no such exclusion). I also purchased a tire protection plan for $200 as part of my lease agreement and that didn’t cover anything either.\nThe worst thing of all - there were some minor scratches and dents (worth $100 or so) which, according to the dealer, should have been covered by the plan but the only option for me was to PAY now to GMFinancial and then fight with the insurance company for reimbursement.\n\nTo me, this is what GM as a company stands for - An absolutely fraudulent dealership run by people who just want to steal your money.

and kindness. Truly, take your business somewhere else.\n\nUnlike every reputable flower shop I’ve ever dealt with, I was never contacted to confirm that I would be home for delivery. Instead, I received a call from the delivery driver already standing at my door while I was out. I told them I would be home in two hours, but they refused to accommodate the wait. When I explained that leaving the arrangement on the sidewalk of a high-traffic street was unsafe, I was told I’d need to pick it up myself.\n\nBoth my sender and I were then contacted by the shop and told that if we wanted the flowers delivered again, we’d have to pay an additional delivery fee. Rather than showing any compassion or even basic professionalism, the shop treated the situation as an opportunity to squeeze more money out of someone already going through a difficult time. Arranging pickup was nearly impossible due to my circumstances, and I wasn’t going to be home for several days (something that could have been easily addressed had they simply called beforehand to coordinate delivery).\n\nWhen we attempted to work with them on a solution, my sender was met with the dismissive response: “I have a business to run.” That comment alone says everything!\n\nThis shop seems to be in the business for all the wrong reasons.

I have been known to drive the extra distance for all things Publix, my entire life. My experiences have always been that of a welcoming team that are helpful, in a clean setting. It's a polite & friendly experience with Publix employees. ....until RIVERSIDE PHARMACY!! I am genuinely floored that this is their \"norm\". I have very serious chronic conditions (like many of us who have go to their local pharmacist numerous times a month). I have NEVER in 30 years of constantly needing medications, dealt with such an all around unprofessionalism! Here's a few examples of what I'm referring to in my 3 months of being this locations \"customer\":  They're unwilling to assist with the most basic scenario. Like, literally, they will not help you. The eye rolling seems contagious behind their counter. After standing in line for 20 minutes, with only 1 person ahead of me who was being \"helped\", I get to the counter and here we go with the attitude because I simply was confused when they said my RX wasn't there but didn't offer any explanation. So ultimately, they sent me to another Publix that was a 45 minute one-way drive just to get there and be politely informed that Riverside sent me to the wrong location that my very important meds were supposedly waiting to be picked up at. And guess what? Then it was too late to make it to the correct Publix. Or how about how their own other locations can't even reach them because no one is answering the calls? Exaggerated sighs have been mastered. Looking people directly in the eyes with disgust that you would dare dream of asking a question is met with pushback. The actual licensed pharmacists don't care anymore than the rest. They absolutely will forget to give you all of your medications so make sure to check the bag like ya do in fast food before driving away. They'll also tell you a medication is ready, you get there and it's not, you're met with attitude, told it won't be ready for hours, only to get home when you're not feeling well, and a text says it's actually ready just as you had thought but were scolded about in person. The ever lovely consistently flippant responses. Unjustifiably arrogant staff! Talk about entitlement! Hail Almighty Riverside!! Please trust me when I say, if unless you are intentionally seeking absolutely inexcusable assistance, then don't make the the same mistake I did by transferring to this location out of convenience if you moved to Riverside as I did. And if you have serious chronic conditions, this is truly THE LAST THING YOU NEED. I truly have asked myself how many people have probably unnecessarily ended up in Emergency Room over this place. You probably thought you were going to attain the normal Publix experience but you're actually not. What I would give for any other location to train EVERYONE in this pharmacy! For that matter, a young child could teach them manners and professional etiquette far better than they are currently practicing. I have driven 35 minutes out of my way to the San Marco Publix Pharmacy who are the normal, fantastic staff that Publix is known for. However, I run a company, I don't have the luxury of lunch breaks, I work long hours, and I am in a battle with my body every single day of my life while fighting health issues that would kick the average person on their ass.

Secondly there is always a long wait. You can be the only person standing there in line and have a full pharmacy of employees and there’s always at least 10 minutes before someone greets you or acknowledges you. We would of never not greeted a customer and let them know we’d right with them. Also I love how they let the “prepaid” customers skip the line only to let them pay for their groceries?? Lol isn’t the point of prepaid being have to just grab your script and go? Also the tech couldn’t figure out if the lady had actually already paid haha so it took about 15 minutes for her to finish her “quick” transaction. Please train your staff.\n\nAs a ex pharmacy tech I have empathy but it’s been enough at this point. Publix texts me TWICE (second text was today) I have refills available okay so I request to have it filled a week ago. The bottle says 2 refills. I get there and  for the whole week since last Friday they never let me know what was going on now Friday afternoon when my medicine is nearly gone I’m being told my dr is no longer at my office and that I have no refills?? I tried to explain I definitely still had refills and show the texts they sent (which some reason the tech had a hard time reading the one sentence text and just stared at my phone for a straight minute). But you could just tell they were done helping me and had no interest in correcting their mistake or even knew what they were doing. It was like talking to a wall. I have contacted my doctor to figure what is going on and to take steps to switch pharmacies. Publix does not value my time so I will not be giving them my business.

He just repeated what he said over and over so I just hanged up and continued to drive. I get there with a long line and waited patiently. I got my correct medication and returned the wrong medication and I told the nice gentleman that helped me to let his pharmacist, Phien, know that “all I needed was to get the correct medication and he did not need to be rude to paying customers.

Why offer walk in flu shots as a service if you’re pharmacist is unhappy about it and not want to accommodate. My husband simply inquired about the walk-in and appointment process.

First of all they discussed your file and details with people that are not even cosigning on the account or a part of the car buying purchase to begin with. I was sold a 2015 Chevy Tahoe, with the steering wheel column cover not on it. They went back-and-forth for months, attempting to order the piece, however, the piece they ordered was not the correct piece. I move out of the state and have only had the vehicle since October 2024, because the steering wheel column cover is not on there that led me to believe that they changed out the ignition switch because they didn’t have a key to the vehicle. well, when my tire goes flat, I try to change the tire with a full spare underneath it and realize that the key lock doesn’t match the key that goes to the ignition nor does the key that goes to the ignition match the key lock on the door. So they have sold me a truck that has one key to it which initially wasn’t a problem… However, now if I lose The clicker, then the key that starts the truck will not open the truck nor release the spare. So! I had to drill out the key lock to access the place where you wind the mechanism down to release the tire only to find out that the crowbar pieces are broken. Thanks a lot CARTIME! Next stop….BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU! I would suggest that everybody report them to the BBB if you have any issues with your vehicle because doing a Google review is not going to hold them accountable.

The day I dropped it off, no one even looked at the car. The following afternoon, I was told by an associate named Nicholas that it needed a new battery and that the sway bar might be covered under the warranty.\n\nThroughout every interaction—both on the phone and in person—Nicholas spoke down to me in a condescending manner. As a woman, I felt I was not taken seriously and was treated as if I didn’t understand basic information, even though the information he provided was incomplete and unclear. He repeatedly interrupted me, would not allow me to ask standard questions, and ultimately hung up on me.\n\nI was later contacted again and told that the sway bar would be covered, but with a $100 deductible. After that, I spoke with the manager, Dave, who did not apologize for the situation and simply answered questions about the parts, stating it would take another day to complete the repairs.\n\nSpending three days in the shop for a battery and sway bar is unreasonable for a dealership that claims to be professional. This is not a small, independent shop—it is a dealership.\n\nOverall, I would recommend going elsewhere to purchase a vehicle.

I can appreciate that if they didn’t know but to give an example of what I had asked would be “Do you know what they ended up fixing/servicing or what was wrong?” - I’m being asked to pay a huge amount of money yet no explanation what it’s for. The women said “They didn’t send you videos when you dropped it off and throughout?” I said no and had no clue what she was referring to, her response was “oh they are supposed to do that.”\nAnytime I called over the week plus they had the vehicle, I literally couldn’t reach my advisor due to “he’s on break”, “he’s on vacation” and my favorite “I don’t know where he is, I’ll have him call you back” ….which never ended up happening.\nAll in all, if I picked it up and everything was tip top shape and working, I wouldn’t have loved the way I was treated but am not a snowflake and would have been fine with it because at the end of the day my vehicle got fixed. Yet, not 2-3 days after I picked it up, the issues that were happening when I dropped it off, lights popped up on my dash and what do you know, same issues still happening. No wonder no one wanted to explain what they fixed when I asked, instead the blanket, yep it’s all fixed and ready to go was given. That sounds better than, oh we just cleared the lights and didn’t actually fix your issue.\nI’ve never had such a horrible experience at a dealership and I have seen a lot of service situations over the years as I used to work at a dealership.\nOverall, when you take care of your vehicle that’s a 2022 with only 22k miles on it and you spent $68k on it new, you want to be informed as to what’s going on when a service department has it for 8 days and hasn’t given you any updates. Instead this dealership treats you like you are bothering them and good luck getting in touch with anyone you are working with both during and after the process.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"1941J33p","ai_response_draft":"That's completely unacceptable - 8 days with no communication and the same issues coming back means we didn't do our job.

I manage multiple medications, and there has not been a single issue that they have been unable to resolve. Their messaging system is exceptionally user-friendly, and their response times are commendably swift. I hold this pharmacy in high esteem.\n\nHowever, I received a notification yesterday indicating that they would cease supplying my Schedule II medication, which they have provided for nearly two years. The notice did not include an explanation for this discontinuation, and as a 72-year-old individual, I particularly valued the convenience of their medication delivery service, as I prefer to avoid unnecessary travel. I am quite distressed by their decision to discontinue this particular medication, necessitating my search for an alternative pharmacy. I prefer to consolidate all my medications in one location.\n\nAt this juncture, I am contemplating whether to continue my relationship with Alto Pharmacy, given that they did not provide any rationale for the cessation of this medication. The absence of an explanation in their correspondence is concerning.

My doctor prescribed a 10-day supply of pain medication, including extra strength Tylenol and Oxycodone (Roxicodone). However, the pharmacist informed me that neither my primary nor secondary insurance would cover a 10-day supply of Roxicodone, which seems unusual given that I previously received a  morphine prescription for previous tonsil abscesses without issue. These medications were for a surgery with general anesthesia.\n\nDespite my concerns, I accepted a 7-day supply of Roxicodone and paid for it, wanting to get home after a long day at the hospital. When I counted the pills before going to sleep, I found that I only received a 6-day supply. I wanted to call the pharmacy as soon as possible given the circumstances and the fact that it had been 6 hours since they were filled, but they were closed. When I called the pharmacy this morning to address this, the pharmacist dismissed my concerns, claiming that a mistake was impossible. He begged to differ and this was a sensitive accusation.\n\nI understand the sensitivity of accusing someone of mishandling narcotics, but I am certain I did not receive the full amount prescribed. I asked the pharmacist if there was a way to review any videos or if a second person verifies the pill count? Given the severity of my pain and the upcoming Memorial Day weekend, this is a significant issue. The 500mg Tylenol I have is not enough to manage my post-surgery pain.\n\nI am very disappointed with the patient care at UCSD Hillcrest's pharmacy and will not be filling future prescriptions there.

I said that I would have complained if I knew who it was. The woman said, \"I'll tell you who it was, it was her!\", as she pointed to Helen who then scurried off to the back while still staring at me. She said, \"she hung on me before\".\n\nI then filed a complaint for her rude behavior. Soon after, strange things started happening.\nFirst, my prescriptions were all of a sudden delayed by several days, then on the next visit, my insurance information was scrubbed from the system. They said, \"We don't know what happened.\"\n\nNext, I was promised a prescription expedite at 11:00am only to call and find out it had been delayed. I could not pickup my prescription now until 2:30pm after the pharmacist lunch. There is no coincidence what is going on here.

Recently in September “2025” I called and was introduced to a guy named Aaron and was told to come in. During this interaction  he introduced himself with a fist bump which is no problem. I met a guy who I’m 15 minutes or less started talking to me about how “hendy” got to go home early after John promised him that he could and showing me his raw papers and how to roll weed. Mind you, I never asked any of this humbly just wanting a vehicle or warranting that information. I was taught respect in life,  nd during the process he was more worried about my girl then me in which withing a phone call he couldn’t remember my name “the buyer” but when I said her name he became enlightened. I was told to come in because I got approved for a car and so I did the same day in which i couldn’t get approved for that car if it wasn’t in their system. As I got there Aaron wanted to shake my girls hand and she decided not to for various reasons and he goes to say “oh this is how I’m getting treated today”  More unprofessional, She’s not the buyer nor repeated customer just a co-signer that needed to produce I.D that’s it. To the point of John coming out telling me the car I just got approved for he just sold it…. Smh Why would you tell me to come in. Yall read between the lines… like I said good experience with Avi but it’s different strokes for different folks. Totally unprofessional days of running around calling out of work for nothing and complete uncomfortable. Understand If you a black man who looks a little young, people may doubt your intelligence. That’s on them. Understanding no matter how much you put down once your approved the bank pays them the car price nd now your paying the bank its loan back so who’s helping who..\nP.s understanding financing a vehicle may seem what’s best cause you short or cash nd need a vehicle  but to pay a car note for years nd have this risk of tow etc just get a car off the street 1500-3000 you’ll be paying wayyyy

Westlake are big SCAMMERS!!\n\nMy husband and I purchased a car less than two months ago. Unfortunately, we had a family emergency that caused his very first payment to be late. As soon as we realized the issue, the payment was made and it went through successfully.\n\nShortly afterward, the car suddenly disappeared from our parking lot. We were worried it had been stolen, so we filed a police report. That’s when we learned that Mainline Auto had picked up the vehicle.\n\nWhat made the situation even more upsetting was that instead of allowing us to simply take the car back after paying any towing or repossession fees, we were told we would need to buy the car again. After only one late payment and after the payment had already been processed, this was extremely discouraging and stressful.\n\nI’m sharing this so future customers can be aware and make sure they understand all policies and procedures before signing.

But during my most recent visit, I learned something surprising: you must purchase a drink in order to receive a Wi-Fi code — a policy that is not posted anywhere in the shop or clearly mentioned on their punch cards. In fact, the cards read “FREE WIFI” prominently, and the only fine print mentions how to earn punches for drinks, with no mention that a purchase is required for internet access.\n\nWhen I calmly brought this up to the manager — without anger or attitude — her demeanor changed immediately. She became noticeably defensive, which strongly suggested to me that this isn’t the first time this concern has been raised, and she knows the signage (or lack thereof) is misleading. That kind of response from management says a lot.\n\nIt’s not the Wi-Fi policy itself that’s the issue — it’s the lack of transparency and the unwillingness to own or correct it when politely addressed. If you’re going to require a purchase for Wi-Fi, that’s fine — just say so clearly on your materials or in the shop. Customers deserve that honesty and clarity.\n\nI hope Bardo will choose to address this in a straightforward way, because until then, it comes across as false advertising — and that erodes trust.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Michael Cardonne","ai_response_draft":"You're right about the punch card - it does say \"FREE WIFI\" without mentioning the purchase requirement.

She spoke back to me in Dutch to which I said I’m sorry I only speak English and she returned in English: Well maybe you should try and learn Dutch. I didn’t say anything at first because I was in shock and then she said if you’re gonna if you’re planning on staying here then you should learn to speak some Dutch. I reply to her and said that’s easy to say but whenever I’ve tried to speak, Dutch people have always spoken back to me in English and she continue saying yeah well you should try anyway. I remain polite because I was also waiting for my antidepressants but it felt very asumptuous for this woman to try and assume why I hadn’t learnt Dutch not understanding that I’ve had mental health issues for the past two years of being here, feeling isolated and also dealing with chronic illness that means that I perhaps haven’t had the time to learn the language. If she was uncomfortable with speaking English, I would’ve very happily have got Google translate out and use that but that didn’t seem to be the issue. She seemed to speak English just fine but was angry that I was not speaking to her in Dutch. when my prescription was ready, She threw it to me across the desk and when I said have a good day she didn’t respond to me at all. I felt so badly treated, especially with a space which is hard enough to navigate anyway when you’re in English speaker. When you’re trying to navigate a healthcare system, insurance and then get your prescription every time when you can’t speak Dutch, yes I would very much like to speak Dutch that would make my life a lot easier here but it’s also not that easy to learn nor should it be expected within the city centre.

I highly recommend them. I took my prescription down to the pharmacy here and was basically scammed. My prescription was for ciprofloxacin, a common inexpensive antibiotic. One cocktail is more expensive than a pack of these pills in the US. The pharmacist was nice and quick and handed me the box and said not to eat dairy with the pills. That is common knowledge for antibiotics and also avoid alcohol for it to be more effective. She gave me a receipt of 61.5 EUROS. The breakdown was less than 9.66 EUROS for the medicine and then 61.15 by the  \"Terhandstelling met bengeleidingsgesprek\" (delivery with conversation) and also listed under \"huisarts\" (GP). This charge was AS MUCH AS the doctor upstairs for the script. After I got home I researched if there was some sort of antibiotic shortage and examined the receipt. I emailed them to get further explanation because I thought surely a reputable place would not intentionally do this. I thought maybe they charged me for the actual doctor's appointment again. However, no response . It seems medically unethical to label the advice as a GP (unless that means googled procedure on not eating dairy) and then charge me that much for it. I confirmed with a pharmacist in my street area that there is no way the medicine would cost that much.  It is also something that should be reported to the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets because judging by other reviews they do the same thing to other foreigners.

I caution others against trusting them, as my experience suggests they prioritize financial gain over ethical legal representation and client care.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Mo Rashwan","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2692,"business_name":"Europa Hair Studio Miami","business_type":"hair salon","address":"3530 Coral Wy Suite R-1, Miami, FL 33145, USA","city":"Miami","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(305) 720-2277","website":"https://www.europahairstudio.com/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":622,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:11:11.461Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2691,"business_name":"STATUS Hair Salon - Brickell","business_type":"hair salon","address":"777 Brickell Ave #170, Miami, FL 33131, USA","city":"Miami","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(305) 306-8238","website":"https://www.nycchichair.com/?utm_campaign=GoogleMyBusiness","google_rating":"4.8","google_reviews_count":699,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:11:11.232Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2690,"business_name":"Red Lion Auto Repair","business_type":"auto repair shop","address":"555 NW 79th St, Miami, FL 33150, USA","city":"Miami","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(786) 530-9995","website":"http://www.redlionauto.com/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":357,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:11:10.110Z","worst_review_text":"So again for further clarification.

If you knew based on the fault code that a teardown would be needed you should have clearly communicated that.\n\nAlso your cashier said the full diagnostic would cover the cost of finding out the issue and the cost of it, in which he misinformed me.

NEVER GO!!\n\nI recently had my manual transmission car's clutch replaced at this shop, with an initial quote of around $1300 (with generous first time customer discount of 15%) and a promised completion time of one day. So, I got my car sent to them via AAA. However, they later informed me that the shaft seal, flywheel, and transmission mount also needed replacement, bringing the total bill to $1600.\n\nWhat was surprising was that the same parts were available at half the price at AutoZone. After paying the bill, I noticed the engine light came on during my drive home. The repair shop suggested I come back the next day for a check, which revealed a clutch circuit sensor issue and an oil smell.\n\nThey wanted to charge $125 for a diagnostic test, but I requested they check the wiring instead. As expected, it was a wiring issue, likely from the transmission work. However, the manager was uncooperative and didn't address the oil smell.\n\nA week later, I took my car to another shop for a wheel rotation and asked them to investigate the oil smell. They found a transmission leak, attributing it to improper fitting during the clutch replacement. When I contacted the original shop, the manager was again unhelpful, suggesting I drop off the car for a day and pay for another diagnostic. They eventually told me the entire gearbox needed replacement with any written estimate.\n\nOverall, the service was subpar, with significant issues arising shortly after the repair. The lack of transparency and customer service was disappointing.\n\nAfter I posted the review on Yelp, the owner threatened me with a text on my private number.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"p h","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2680,"business_name":"Herb Chambers MINI of Boston Service Center","business_type":"auto repair shop","address":"1168 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02134, USA","city":"Boston","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(617) 731-1700","website":"https://www.herbchambersmini.com/?utm_source=google%20my%20business&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=visit%20website","google_rating":"4.9","google_reviews_count":651,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:10:59.385Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2679,"business_name":"Serpa Law Office","business_type":"law firm","address":"20 Park Plaza #400A, Boston, MA 02116, USA","city":"Boston","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(617) 936-0201","website":"https://serpalaw.com/","google_rating":"5.0","google_reviews_count":216,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:10:58.349Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2678,"business_name":"1 Mi Taller Auto Repair","business_type":"auto repair shop","address":"51-06 70th St, Woodside, NY 11377, USA","city":"New York","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(718) 424-7289","website":"http://mitallerauto.com/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":217,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:10:56.084Z","worst_review_text":"They are the worst.\nTook long time to retouch (painting) my car.\nThey didn’t use prime when painting.\nThe paint it’s pealing now.\nThey wanted the job because it was through insurance.

As beautiful as, modern, and sharp the hotel design is, I have learned that not all fancy designed properties may not prioritize the little things… none of which were addressed when we reported them after our first night. We spent 3 nights and items remained unresolved… shower doors not closing, shower ventilation not working, to be provided with linen that is hypoallergenic... all of which hotel staff confirm they are aware of these issues. Some sort of detergent choice of the hotel made it extremely uncomfortable to sleep unless I heavily sedated myself with allergy medication. Hypoallergenic should be a priority because it is environmentally friendly and customer comforting.\n\nWe did find in our research that accommodations are not necessarily “cheap” in Germany. It’s primarily a result of covid, and the war in Ukraine what locals have explained to us. So it is difficult to find a hotel with affordable breakfast included.  However, most properties we stayed in for our two weeks of travel included coffee and tea stations in the lobby… not at Hotel am Beatles-Platz. We were told the coffee and tea we need to pay for from their restaurant, which is the same self serve machine as most other hotels offered guests access to. There may have been a misunderstanding because they did not charge us when we checked out. There was a very cute candy station in the lobby, but if you’re diabetic… this isn’t helpful which I wonder again why they offer a fancy candy station over simple coffee/team service. The toiletries were nice. However, the soap dispensers were difficult to use… it was like begging for drops of soap. We were provided with a vanity kit that was empty from day one and I positioned it for the staff yo see, but ignited every day. The body loation was never filled as well.\n\nWe understand these are small things and it’s possible small complaints that are not relevant for many people, but these are the little things we look for to make our stay comfortable. We have stayed at extremely small priorities that were over 100-200 years old, and these were never things we had to worry about.\n\nSeparately and not an issue created by the hotel… We did pay a significant amount of money for this property and as much as some European counties are proud of their red light districts, this Beatles Platz neighborhood was quite dirty, unacceptably loud until 5 o’clock in the morning each night. In North America, you are discouraged from living or staying at hotels in these bar and strip club zones but the online advertising for Beatles Platz was quite alluring… and we saw after arriving, we would have never picked here based on how bar zones are viewed in North America. Teens and youth out until odd hours singing, screaming, breaking bottles making it difficult to sleep in addition to the already challenging environment we were trying to address with the hotel. Similarly, the dining I would discourage that is offered in the area.  Endless bar food and even Turkish restaurants… but all “fast food”. Save your money and you will find much more nicer Turkish restaurants throughout Hamburg.\n\nI don’t hate this property Hotel am Beatles-Platz, I just would not recommend it if the small things are important for you.  It was comical because we couldn’t not use the broken coat hook, but the hospitality staff would use it to hang the hotel cleaning information from… knowing the hook is broken.

After a very long 15-hour journey, during which I was exhausted and had not slept at all, I kindly asked at the reception if it was possible to check in earlier, even around 10:00 AM. I was refused without any effort to help, so I was forced to wander around outside. There is no proper waiting area — only dirty, uncleaned tables with cheap black plastic chairs, and extremely loud music playing above them. It is impossible to rest or relax there.\n\nThe service is absolutely terrible. I asked for water because I was extremely thirsty, and the receptionist brought me tap water in a very small cup. When I explained how thirsty I was, he said they could not provide any other water.\n\nThe room itself is awful. I will not even go into details about the bathroom — it is impossible to shower properly, especially to wash both your body and hair. They provide only two towels, and once the bathroom floor is completely wet, there is nothing left to dry it or yourself. When I arrived, the soap provided was almost empty, with only a tiny amount left at the bottom.\n\nThe worst part of this hotel is the housekeeping staff. Yesterday, while I was sleeping, someone tried to open my door. I was terrified and in shock. When I asked who it was, they said it was housekeeping and told me to open the door, saying that I was supposed to leave that day. She spoke to me in a very rude way. When I tried to speak German, she replied aggressively that she did not understand and demanded that I speak English, asking if I understood her or not. The level of disrespect was shocking.\n\nThe hotel does not provide “Do Not Disturb” signs at all. This happened again this morning.

This is the first Google review I have ever written, and that says a lot. My son and I were 60 seconds past our appointment grace window and were denied services. Literally one minute past. I attempted to ask for some “grace” and “understanding” as this was our last day of school, I’m a teacher, and I have two children I’m trying to manage. I was told that my 1 minute was cutting into other people’s appointment times which is a load of garbage. I guarantee you that the doctors aren’t being penalized for being 1 min late to their patient appointments. Where is the humanity. I would never have denied services to someone who was doing their best at 1 minute past. The assistant manager who I spoke with was also incredibly rude to me. They only regurgitated the same script with an unprofessional tone and body language. This appointment was time sensitive to our family. I respectfully declined when offered a new appointment.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Mae Von

had previously visited the Vi Café in Zurich and was not satisfied. This time, I tried the Basel location today, hoping for a better experience.\n\nIt was very cold outside, so I ordered a hot drink: a chai latte with oat milk. Unfortunately, the drink I received was clearly cold.\n\nWhen I asked if it could be reheated or remade, I was told very firmly that this was “not possible.” I honestly could not understand how reheating or remaking a chai latte could be considered impossible. This is not a language issue — the explanation simply did not make sense.\n\nAt one point, the staff member touched the cup and insisted that it was warm. Even if it felt warm to them, it was not warm to me. Temperature is subjective, and what matters is the customer’s experience.\n\nI drink coffee and hot beverages outside regularly and do not make a habit of sending drinks back. Expecting a hot drink to be hot is not an unreasonable request. Being treated as if I were asking for something extraordinary was uncomfortable and unprofessional.\n\nIn the end, I drank the chai latte only because I had paid for it. I did not enjoy it at all. This experience made me seriously question how much customer satisfaction is valued.\n\nNever again.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Mina

attended several sessions at this clinic, and unfortunately I cannot recommend their services for the following reasons:\n\nDuring treatment with Jelmer for a shoulder injury, I was referred and scheduled to see Lennard for a different issue on 12 December at 2:00 PM. However, on that day I received an automated confirmation email stating that the appointment was at 12:00 PM. I arrived at the clinic at the time indicated in the email and waited for 40 minutes, only to be informed that no appointment had been scheduled for me that day—despite having a written confirmation email clearly stating otherwise.\n\nA new appointment was then scheduled for the following week, which proceeded as expected.\n\nSubsequently, a follow-up session was booked for 5 January at 12:00 PM. On the day of the appointment, I received again a confirmation email—this time at 10:48 AM—stating that my appointment was at 11:00 AM, creating yet another discrepancy in their scheduling system.\n\nI attempted to clarify this by calling four times and sending an email to confirm whether the appointment time had changed or was still set for 12:00 PM. I received no response whatsoever. Given that this was the second instance of conflicting information, the lack of communication, and the proximity to the appointment time, I couldn’t not attend it, and to avoid once again wasting time traveling to a potentially nonexistent appointment.\n\nDespite these circumstances, I was later issued an invoice of €50 for a missed appointment—even though the confirmation they provided was incorrect and all reasonable efforts were made on my part to verify the booking.\n\nOverall, the clinic demonstrated a lack of respect for clients’ time and availability and failed to take accountability for repeated administrative errors. Additionally, I did not notice any improvement in my condition following the sessions, which further reinforces that the service was not worth the time or cost.\n\nJust be aware, can be you next time.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Guilherme Brandão","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2619,"business_name":"The Dick Vet General Practice","business_type":"veterinary clinic","address":"Easter Bush Campus, Edinburgh EH25 9RG, UK","city":"Edinburgh","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0131 650 7650","website":"https://www.ed.ac.uk/vet/services/small-animals/appointments","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":57,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:01:28.812Z","worst_review_text":"The incompetence and disregard for the health of my cat is mind-blowing.  I came to see the Vet as my cat seemed to have a urinary infection and bloody urine.  After the exam and medication that was prescribed, I was asked to bring in a urine sample from the cat the next day.  I brought the sample in early Thurs morning, and it was very red/bloody. I did not get a call back about the results, so on the next Tuesday (they had the sample for 6 days) at around 10, I called. I got a call back just before 4 from a nurse who told me the BLOODY SAMPLE WAS SITTING ON THE RECEPTION DESK FOR 6 DAYS.  The nurse wanted to know if I wanted the sample sent in since it was old and the result may not be accurate.  THERE WAS NO MENTION OF TALKING TO A VET OR MANAGEMENT ABOUT THE ISSUE. AND NO CONCERN FOR THE HEALTH OF MY CAT. I had to determine what to do with the sample. I asked to speak to a manager, and she told me not to expect a call back for 2-3 days!! Not believing the message would be relayed, I called back an hour later and asked to talk to a manager or a vet. I still could not get past the receptionist. I was told to email my complaint.  THERE WAS NO ONE IN CHANGE IN ANY MANNER THAT I COULD SPEAK TO NOR COULD I SPEAK TO A SENIOR VET. I asked to have a Vet call me as I had no idea what to do and was concerned about my cat.  The receptionist could not understand why I wanted to talk to a Vet. I had to explain why I would be concerned about my cat, who had bloody urine compounded by their mistake. You would think Dicks Vet of the University of Edinburgh would be first and for most a veterinarian practice.  The bloody sample sat on the desk for 6 days, and how many receptionists saw it and did nothing.  Why when I called and the mistake discovered was a vet not consulted for advice about what to do FOR THE HEALTH OF THE ANIMAL before calling me. The whole things was just covered up! I still have not spoken to a Vet.\n\nUpdate: later in the evening, I did receive a call from a Vet who was amazingly kind and understanding.  She seemed to really understand the concerns was that no thought had been given to my pet.  So I am happy with the Vet response.

I cannot say that it was bad however it certainly was not good.\n\nThe Facial was decent. I actually think that the products that were used and the technique were good.\n\nThe head massage was not good and I personally found it to be annoying as I specifically asked twice for no oils/creams to be used on my scalp/hair for medical reasons however my request was completely ignored which is very ignorant.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI am not sure I would recommend this place as there are multiple other, much professional options in this price range.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"M.

While the music was calming, the facilities were filled with plastic plants, polyester wall hangings, and clean but crunchy towels - and an odd hole in the flooring. I was hoping the massage would make up for the environs, it did not. The massage was more like someone putting on lotion for me. I did note the one area I needed extra massage but it was missed.

recently visited the Four Seasons for afternoon tea and, unfortunately, the experience was disappointing and fell well below the standard expected of a five-star hotel.\n\nUpon arrival, we waited approximately 45 minutes for the tea & food to arrive, which significantly affected the overall experience.\n\nWhen the food was finally served, the savoury selection was very limited in quantity compared to the sweet items, creating an unbalanced offering. Additionally, all items were served at the same time. While this made for an attractive presentation, it resulted in hot items such as the scones and sticky toffee pudding with sauce becoming cold by the time we reached them.\n\nThat said, the food itself was very delicious, which made the service and timing issues particularly disappointing. Additionally, if you are expecting a traditional afternoon tea experience, this is not the one — it felt more like all snacks being served at the same time, rather than a paced afternoon tea service.\n\nThroughout the experience, no additional hot water for the tea was offered, which is a basic expectation for afternoon tea service. Furthermore, when we enquired about the possibility of a small savoury top-up, we were informed that this would be chargeable. This is not standard practice at most afternoon tea venues and is particularly surprising at a hotel of the Four Seasons’ calibre.\n\nOverall, the experience did not meet the expectations associated with a five-star establishment. We hope this feedback is taken constructively and helps improve the service for future guests.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Adrienn Nagy","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2599,"business_name":"Denver Health: Lowry Family Health Center","business_type":"medical clinic","address":"1001 Yosemite St, Denver, CO 80230, USA","city":"Denver","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(303) 602-4545","website":"https://www.denverhealth.org/locations/denver/lowry-family-health-center-1001-yosemite-st-denver-80230","google_rating":"3.3","google_reviews_count":108,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:59:23.001Z","worst_review_text":"Male Employee at the pharmacy is not good at all.

was very much looking forward to my appointment. It's a long story I had already written a review but I took down my post. I do feel writing this is necessary. I was unimpressed with the staff. I did appreciate Edda calling me to try and make things right, but of course this was after my review. So to me it felt like she was only calling so I could take my review down. This whole experience has left a bad taste. I don't trust this salon anymore the beginning was terrible. Please have your receptionist trained better. When I received the call my appointment was being canceled. The verbiage was \" Edda was being pulled in multiple directions and won't reschedule me.\" Lots of Umms and Uhh with the person I spoke to, He was not nice at all. Very rude and condescending. This was after a 250$ deposit. A couple days later when I spoke to Edda she did apologize and said \" I am sorry you were caught in the cross fire of everything\". Such a weird way to go about things. Yes life happens, but I was a new client to build a report like this was a terrible way to go about it. After thinking about it, I truly just feel disappointed and I won't be returning. I hope I am the only client they have done this too. And I hope that whenever they book new Clients they don't overbook themselves since that is what happened to me.

Based on those representations, I flew from Salt Lake City to Portland specifically to view and potentially purchase the vehicle.\n\nAt the end of the test drive, the car triggered multiple fault codes and a flashing check engine light, which is forgivable considering it was a used car however, while attempting to explain the situation away, the salesperson accidentally showed me text messages from their mechanic confirming that this was a known, recurring issue and that the codes had been cleared previously instead of the underlying problem being properly repaired. This directly contradicted everything I had been told prior to traveling at my own expense, and shows how Columbia Motors chooses to do business.\n\nDespite this clear evidence, the issue was minimized as “just a software update.” After flying back to Salt Lake City and after a month of horrible communication from my salesperson I was later assured that the vehicle had been fully repaired and that the problem had been resolved.\n\nTrusting those assurances, I flew back to Portland a second time. Within approximately 15 minutes of driving the car, the exact same failure occurred again multiple fault codes and a flashing check engine light. When I spoke to the salesman about my frustration from the lack of transparency on our first visit (the known issue and clearing the codes) he of course pretended like it never happened..... At that point, it was undeniable that the issue had not been properly diagnosed or repaired and that the assurances I had been given were simply not accurate and intentionally misleading.\n\nWhat made this experience even more disappointing was the complete lack of accountability afterward. There was no meaningful acknowledgment of the inconvenience, cost, or time lost from two separate trips made solely based on the dealership’s representations. I was told that someone would follow up with a solution, yet no one ever did. Communication stopped, and responsibility was avoided rather than addressed.\n\nThis is not simply a case of a used car having an unexpected issue. This was a known problem that was not disclosed intentionally, minimized repeatedly, and then represented as fixed when it clearly was not. That level of transparency and professionalism is simply unacceptable.\n\nAfter wasting about $1,500 and dealing with months of awful communication I am left without a car, solution or even an apology. After returning from my SECOND trip to Portland I am left with no response from anyone at Columbia Motors. The entire experience was frustrating, costly, and frankly disheartening. I expected basic honesty and professionalism. Instead, I was left feeling misled and disregarded once the problems became inconvenient for the dealership.\n\nWhatever Columbia's response may be know that they do not deal in good faith.\n\nFor your own sake AVOID Columbia Motors at all costs.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Baron

would like to share my experience working with Austin Auto Planet as a 21-year-old young woman. I do feel I was taken advantage of due to my age and this being my first auto loan.\nAt the end of November, I purchased a 2018 Kia Sportage. A family friend and I test drove the car, and when I reached highway speeds to test acceleration, the check engine light immediately came on. There were also a few other concerns I brought up while checking out the car. When I returned from the test drive, the owner said it was a misfire and that he would fix it. I mentioned the other concerns and he brushed them off as not important. I came back later that evening, took the car back out, and the light was off, so I moved forward with the purchase (I should have walked away).\nAfter having the car for only 12 days and roughly 500 miles, while driving to work at the same highway speed (around 70 mph), the check engine light came on again. I immediately called my dad, and he advised me to contact the dealer and try to return the car since this was my first loan. I stopped at AutoZone, where they pulled code P0234, which indicates a turbo overboost condition that can cause serious engine damage if not fixed.\nWhen I brought the car back to the dealership, the owner immediately told me this was a new issue and once again said it was not important. I have him on recording stating that he cleared the original check engine light because the codes were “history,” and while we were test driving the car together, he cleared the check engine light again right in front of me.\nAlthough he offered to fix the car, my bank advised that I try to give it back. I went back and forth with him asking to return the vehicle, but he undermined my concerns and repeatedly brushed them off by saying, “I said I fix it for you.” I ended up leaving the car with him on December 4.\nOn December 6, he told me he needed to order a part and showed me a part listing from eBay. He said the part would arrive between December 10–13. The part arrived on December 16, but it was broken, and the car was not returned to me until December 20. He had my car for 16 days (December 4–20)!!!\n\nDuring this time, I had to Uber to work while working two jobs. I spent $613.72 on Uber while my car sat at his dealership. It wasn’t until the day before the car was fixed that he agreed to provide a loaner vehicle.\n\nThis is not an honest dealership. The owner admitted he does not run safety inspections on his cars and said I should be glad he was “honest enough” to tell me upfront. However, his website claims he sells quality vehicles and performs a rigorous multi-point inspection, which was not my experience at all.\nAfter getting the car back, I took it to my personal mechanic again, and they encouraged me to sell the car and not have anything further to do with this dealership.\n\nPlease be aware of who you are dealing with before purchasing from this lot.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Qiana Stofferahn","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2551,"business_name":"Monkey Nest Coffee","business_type":"coffee shop","address":"5353 Burnet Rd, Austin, TX 78756, USA","city":"Austin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(512) 505-8033","website":"http://monkeynestcoffee.com/","google_rating":"4.4","google_reviews_count":1844,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:55:14.826Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2550,"business_name":"optik atelier käser","business_type":"optician","address":"Blumenrain 21, 4051 Basel, Switzerland","city":"Basel","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"061 281 17 17","website":"https://www.optik-atelier.ch/","google_rating":"5.0","google_reviews_count":96,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:55:13.369Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2549,"business_name":"VIU - Optiker & Brillengeschäft","business_type":"optician","address":"Spalenberg 20, 4051 Basel, Switzerland","city":"Basel","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"044 508 79 12","website":"https://shopviu.com/de-ch/viu-stores/store/basel?utm_source=google_maps&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gmb&utm_content=websitelink&utm_term=basel","google_rating":"4.6","google_reviews_count":178,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:55:13.112Z","worst_review_text":"The current way of hospitality is completely contrary to the original intention of starting this business.\n\nI took my child to the store, hoping to test his eyesight within the three-month warranty period and consider whether the lenses need to be adjusted.

It never happened.\n\n3- After 8 years and only 65000 km, and in the span of 3 months, i paid ~3500 Euros in repairs for stuff that just broke in the engine and horn; nothing from reckless use or anything. And, the sad thing is; in some of those visits, i couldn't speak in English with my appointed person even though they know English! I try with my little German to bridge the gap. And, i don't see them try the same to help me understand what's wrong with my car. I pay a lot of money, and i deserve to know what's wrong with my car.\n\n4- After one repair in the motor, which cost me the ~2600 Euros, my motor couldn't start the motion of the car smoothly anymore. A friend told me to switch from e10 to e5 benzine. It made things better. But, still i went to BMW because this problem only appeared after they repaired my car. I had the following conversation with them:\n\nMe: my car wouldn't start smoothly with e10 anymore after you repaired my motor. e5 works fine, but not e10\nThey: yeah, e5 is better because blah blah blah...\nMe: but, it's written on the tank opening that the car may use e10\nThey: yeah, that's just for the regulations and law in Germany.\n\nI was speechless. I know the guy must be wrong of course, because it's a serious problem if BMW uses this kinds of tricks. And a big name like BMW wouldn't do that for sure. But, how can I respond to such idiocracy when i hear it?!\nThey told me that nothing is wrong with my car. Later afterwards, even the e5 benzine wouldn't make the start of the motion smooth anymore. The car would kinda jump or hump before it moves; after only 65000 km!\n\n5- As i left the branch one time, i got a feedback form from a person at the counter to rate my experience. I put in a bad feedback about the branch and about her. I asked her where to put the form. She said that she'll take it and pass it on. How on earth would i trust someone I'm complaining against to pass on my feedback to their superiors? Of course, i didn't get any call back from BMW to see why their customer wasn't satisfied.\n\nThat's only from top of my head. If i remember more experiences, I'll add them to my review here.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Shady

Two of us even took vacation days, and our third friend had just been laid off, so we were all counting on a relaxing, much needed day together. The plan was to ride together and make a whole day of it.\n\nAbout 40 minutes before our appointments, the temporary spa manager called to say they didn’t have enough therapists. They were trying to find someone, but one of us would need to come in immediately for an earlier appointment instead of all three of us going together as scheduled. After scrambling to figure it out, the friend who lived closest drove separately to take the earlier slot.\n\nFrom the beginning, the session felt awkward, clunky, and unprofessional. Even after asking Chris for more pressure, it was so light I joked to myself that a cat could have pressed harder. He stayed in the same spot for so long that I genuinely wondered if my skin was going to be rubbed raw. It was as if he had never been taught, had seen, nor received a massage before. He only moved when I finally asked him to, and each area was the same uncomfortable and ineffective pushing of skin. I even considered stopping the massage altogether, but I kept hoping it would improve with more communication.\n\nWhen it ended, almost abruptly, he simply pointed down the hall and told me to change “down there.” I had to ask someone else for directions. Meanwhile, my friends were in the lounge sipping mimosas and raving about “the best massage of my life,” complete with warm booties and thoughtful parting instructions. I didn’t want to ruin their mood, but they immediately noticed something was wrong. They were upset on my behalf and got a mimosa from the front to cheer me up.\n\nAt checkout, I explained what happened. The receptionist apologized, removed the deep tissue upcharge, and said the manager would contact me that afternoon to offer a massage redo. That call never came.\n\nMonths passed with no followup until today, when I got a text saying they “missed me” and would love to see me again. I couldn’t help but laugh, and decided it was finally time to write this review.\n\nI have used my Google account that does not list my name. If the spa would like to verify that I was actually there, please check your appointment calendar for April 25, 2025 around 9AM.

Not too long to get into the city by train.\n\nThe room itself was overall terrible. Space was decent but no basic in-room amenities including fridge, kettle or tissue box. The beds were 2 king single beds pushed together and pillows were terrible - I woke up with a sore neck as a result. The worst part of the room was the bathroom. This was room 110 - stay clear of this room unless they renovate the bathroom. Anyone who has stayed in this room would understand. As mentioned in a previous review with photos of the same bathroom, the bathroom is extremely outdated. Feels like a bathroom that belongs in a nursing home/aged care facility. There was also a very musky sewerage smell that was wreaking from the bathroom - basically smelt like urine especially if the door is kept closed.\n\nTo top off this terrible experience, there is no sort of ventilation in room 110 - no fan and no air conditioning. As a result, we needed to leave the window open for air flow. This proved to be a very bad idea. We quickly found out that room 110 is directly above the entrance of this hotel.

Check the interest rates they give you if financing with them, and if financing independent from the dealership ensure that you can get a loan for a branded title vehicle. Some insurance companies and banks/credit unions will not support you for a branded title.\n\nThe \"free delivery\" on the website is only if you are located very far away, I made a 2 hour trip to the dealership and when asked about getting the car shipped they said I didn't live far enough away. So it is free shipping, at their discretion.\n\nWas given a hard time when I asked them to remove bad tint from moisture problems, but eventually they did. Within 24 hours of getting the car, I found out why there were moisture problems; it rained and I had a leak in the rear roof from the taillight above the rear window not being installed  properly. I took it in to get fixed, only to find instead.of installing the light properly they pushed it into place (cracking the light) and used some caulk or putty to seal it. Guess they couldn't fix it the right way. Bumper also wasnt fitted correctly.  I gave up on trying to get help from them since I had to drive 2 hours each way and would need a rental vehicle while they spend an undisclosed amount of time \"fixing\" each issue that popped up. Not even an offer for a loaner vehicle after needing to take it back after already making multiple trips. They felt helpful in the beginning but it became clear they sold me a problem car and would only band aid issues as I mentioned them, I dont know why they couldn't have checked the car for quality prior to sale. I guess the less they have to fix upfront, the easier it is for them.\n\nIts been a couple of months since then, took it to a reputable shop and got most of the problems addressed, including some other minor (but irritable) problems that were found. Overall, the car is fine. Probably wouldn't recommend anyone go here unless you like to gamble! Do your research,  ask questions, and don't buy the same day you look is my advice. Three stars seems fair to me since the Branded Title situation felt sketchy and overall they didnt feel transparent with the condition of the car and providing band aid fixes instead of proper fixes for issues such as the water leak from the poorly installed, and then broken, tail light. Some cars may be in better condition than others and you wouldn't have the same experience as me, just be diligent! If you buy from here I hope it goes smoother than my experience.

The only highlight of this establishment is the location and presentation of the food. The photos speak for themselves, the food LOOKS amazing.\n\nHowever not even the food it self makes up for the poor service because it is FILLED with custard to a point it is the only thing you can taste. Nothing we tried tasted like the actual food because the custard was so prevalent and overwhelmed any other flavor we may have been able to enjoy.\n\nThe coffee is ok, it’s not bad by any means but it tastes closer to a cup of Folgers than something that warrants the price they charge for it here.\n\nOverall I would never go here again. There are so many other places nearby that are far cheaper with better service and better tasting food/coffee.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Tyler Pope","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2386,"business_name":"Harbor Coffee","business_type":"coffee shop","address":"331 Elizabeth St NE suite c, Atlanta, GA 30307, USA","city":"Atlanta","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(404) 678-1561","website":"http://www.harborcoffeeatl.com/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":177,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:49:04.073Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2385,"business_name":"El Viñedo Local","business_type":"coffee shop","address":"730 Peachtree St NE Suite 100, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA","city":"Atlanta","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(404) 596-8239","website":"https://www.elvinedolocal.com/","google_rating":"4.9","google_reviews_count":6497,"email":"welcome@elvinedolocal.com","email_verified":false,"email_source":"upgrade_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"contacted","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:49:03.855Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2384,"business_name":"Foxtail Coffee - Midtown","business_type":"coffee shop","address":"1230 W Peachtree St NW unit 120, Atlanta, GA 30309, USA","city":"Atlanta","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(470) 788-8006","website":"https://www.foxtailcoffee.com/locations/foxtail-coffee-midtown","google_rating":"4.6","google_reviews_count":575,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:49:03.620Z","worst_review_text":"Pretty bummed.

lenses wearers be very weary. I was very excited to get new glasses and contacts at a convenient downtown location was very disappointed in the customer service I received. The doctor was excellent and after a very thorough exam, my contact prescription for both eyes was downgraded significantly. When I went to order new contacts from the front desk they did not have them in stock due to my strong prescription and I received a wait time of 3-5 days, which is totally reasonable. I let them know I only have contacts in the wrong prescription and have a new glasses appointment scheduled there for later in the week. Most people know wearing the wrong contact prescription can cause strain on your eyes and severe headaches which I was experiencing. I reached out again hoping I could receive a trial pack of contacts in my correct prescription even if I had to pay extra so that I would not have to deal with intense headaches and eye strain during the work week. Front desk assured me this was not possible and there was nothing they could do for me. Despite my pleas to contact the doctor, I was never allowed to. No other attempts were made to accommodate me. Unfortunately, apathy seems to be the standard now for medical care in the city.

If you need to prescription lenses, I can't yet recommend them. The quality of lenses their manufacturer can produce is unacceptable for their $500 to $600 price (before their %20 first time discount). They are trying one more time to get a good lens, but the rep was dismissive of the scratches that encompassed the surface. The pictures with the green tint/reflection are my 2 year old pair that are far more scratched than when I first got them. Those with a purple tint/reflection are attempts one and two for the new prescription that have a similar to worse amount of scratches and haze as my old pair.

We did not have an appointment, but Jared grabbed the keys and was able to let us test drive the vehicle while he was waiting for an appointment to show. We ended up liking the vehicle enough to move forward with the purchase, which Jared was able to help with. He even mentioned their extended warranty to cover any issues or repairs that the car may need, which we also added at the time of purchase. This interaction was cordial and friendly, we left happy and had a new vehicle.\n\nUnfortunately, these are the last good things I can say about this dealership.\n\nImmediately after purchase, the vehicle threw a check engine light for a faulty thermostat that needed to be replaced. We took the vehicle to a Mazda Dealership as directed by our \"warranty\", only to find that the thermostat repair would not be covered by this program, nor would they cover any of the other service items that the vehicle needed as recommended by the inspection. This caused an additional out of pocket expense that we were not expecting based on the sale of our extended warranty coverage. For an additional $3,000 on top of the purchase price of the vehicle, the expectation was set that repairs would be heavily discounted or paid entirely by this program.\n\nAfter this experience and paying for the repairs out of pocket, we went to attempt to cancel this warranty. This is a process that can only be initiated by the dealer, so we needed to reach out to PDX Motors directly. We contacted PDX Motors to cancel this warranty in writing on 4/9/25. PDX Motors sent the refund for this warranty to our lender on 5/30/25. From the time that the warranty was originally requested to be canceled to the time the refund was issued took nearly 2 months, and countless calls and emails that went unanswered. Had I not have continuously followed up, we may still be waiting. When speaking with the warranty company, they confirmed cancelation on 4/25/25 and confirmed that they issue payment within 5 business days.\n\nLastly, while waiting for this warranty refund to be issued, the vehicle caught fire during a road trip while stopping for gas. The car burned completely to the ground without warning and was a total loss through insurance. While I don't necessarily blame PDX Motors for this, it certainly doesn't inspire buying confidence when coupled with check engine lights and other hidden repairs being needed.\n\nIf you are going to purchase a vehicle from these people, make sure you get an independent inspection. I went against my better judgement, skipped one with this vehicle, and quite literally got burned.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Ryan

So far I am happy with the car I bought. I'm leaving a 2 star review for two reasons. First off, I originally came to look at the Honda Fit that I ended up purchasing. However, Santos suggested another Honda Fit. He was trying to entice me with the paint-job and interior. He didn't suggest a test drive for this one. Red Flag. When I took it for a test drive, it had obvious mechanical issues and it didn't have working AC. ALSO, when we were test driving, he didn't tell me to go on the freeway. On the test drive for the other Fit, he insisted on going on the freeway, but he didn't with this one. And as soon as we hit the freeway, you immediately noticed the mechanical issues. HUGE red flag. It was also a year older than the Fit I was originally looking at, and it had more milage. On top of all of that, it had paint damage, cloudy lights, and very bad rusting under the hood. despite all of these things, BOTH Honda Fits were the same price. I told Santos that I didn't like that he even suggested a car to me that had machanical issues. Santos told me that they 'have a lot of cars on the lot' and said something along the lines of 'he doesn't know every issue with every car'. Okay, but you're suppose to? If you sell me a car, you're supposed to know everything that's wrong with it. Second, after I bought the Fit I ended up going with, the trunk wouldn't open because the lock was broken. They told me to come back and they would fix it for free. I told them to put it in writing and they did. That part was more acceptable. This dealership has better ratings than others in the area, but frankly if you're a buyer and you're reading this, ALL used car lots I've ever dealt with are semi-sketchy, unfortunately. It wasn't really SURPRISING that as a woman who went to a car dealership alone, they would suggest a car that clearly has mechanical issues, expecting me to not test drive it or inspect it at all. If you’re buying a car from these people, you need to fully inspect the car and take it for a long test drive!!!!

She is thorough, professional, has great energy, and explains everything clearly during the exam. I’ve seen her several times and have even referred friends because of the quality of her care.\n\nHowever, my experience during the glasses checkout portion of the visit was disappointing. I’m used to being walked through my insurance benefits, pricing, add-ons, and what is or isn’t covered. Instead, I was immediately asked to pay my copay, and I had to clarify that I was also getting glasses.\n\nThe staff member assisting me wasn’t rude, but she felt checked out and made several assumptions, as if I should already know the process. I gave her polite feedback, and while she was initially defensive, she ultimately listened and apologized. She explained she assumed I knew everything since I’d been there before. I shared that I only come once a year at most, and I still expect to be guided through the standard steps—especially because insurance benefits and pricing change frequently. The interaction ended respectfully.\n\nUnfortunately, as I was leaving, one of the receptionists gave me clear attitude when I said goodbye, signaling she was displeased that I had offered feedback to her coworker. It was uncomfortable and unprofessional. I stepped outside, sat in my car, and debated whether I should let it go or report the behavior. I decided to go back in. As I re-entered, the same receptionist walked out and again gave me attitude, which led me to feel even more frustration. The situation felt unnecessary and unprofessional.\n\nI then asked for contact information for the doctor to formally share my experience, but the staff did not have a clear method for connecting with her. At that moment, the original staff member I had spoken with told me she had actually forgotten to take my measurements, so I needed to sit back down to complete a step that should have been done earlier.\n\nOverall, the exam with Dr. Shah was wonderful, but the checkout and front-desk experience left me feeling uncomfortable and dismissed. I’m sharing this in hopes that it can be addressed so future visits reflect the same professionalism and care that Dr. Shah provides.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Rosie Chavez","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2347,"business_name":"Quality Vision Eyewear","business_type":"optician","address":"2800 S I-35 Frontage Rd #125, Austin, TX 78704, USA","city":"Austin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(512) 462-0001","website":"https://qveyewear.wixsite.com/qveyewear","google_rating":"4.9","google_reviews_count":690,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:48:51.835Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2346,"business_name":"Lone Star Eye","business_type":"optician","address":"7415 Southwest Pkwy Bldg 6 Ste 300, Austin, TX 78735, USA","city":"Austin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(512) 982-9560","website":"https://www.lonestareyecenter.com/?utm_source=gbp&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website_url","google_rating":"4.8","google_reviews_count":717,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:48:51.616Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2345,"business_name":"Austin Optometrists","business_type":"optician","address":"500 E Ben White Blvd d600, Austin, TX 78704, USA","city":"Austin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(512) 912-0920","website":"https://www.austinoptometristspllc.com/","google_rating":"4.4","google_reviews_count":115,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:48:51.396Z","worst_review_text":"Avoid this clinic if possible.

So I went again (for the 5th time in total, I don't know... or something???), because it can't be true that the new (explicit) computer glasses are worse than my 13-year-old long-sightedness glasses. The boss - I think his name is Mr. Fromberger - had no desire at all to make me glasses that fit. He came straight to me with the reimbursement form and was rather rude to me at first. After a few minutes of consideration—I've actually been wanting to finally get a pair of glasses that fit for almost six weeks and five or six visits to the office—I got the refund form because I didn't want to put up with the boss's rude attitude.

purchased a new Audi S6 Avant e-tron (2025) from the authorized dealer Porsche Graz-Kärntnerstraße. Immediately after delivery, serious defects appeared – in particular, the repeated error message \"High-voltage electrical system: malfunction,\" which prevents the vehicle from starting and the charging ports from opening, as well as the sudden failure of the left digital exterior mirror while driving.\nThese defects pose an acute risk to the health and life of the vehicle's occupants. If the digital mirror suddenly fails while driving, safe maneuvering or reacting to traffic is impossible. The risk of an accident is real.\nDespite several visits to authorized Audi workshops, the defects persist. Furthermore, the service employees cannot specify exactly which problems the planned software updates are actually intended to resolve, which gives the impression of a trial-and-error approach.\nThis approach is unacceptable to me as a customer. With a new vehicle, you expect a functioning and safe product – not an immature experiment.\nI am seriously considering withdrawing from the purchase agreement, but have initially granted a reasonable period of grace. As a customer-friendly solution, I prefer a buyback from Audi AG or, in the worst case, a replacement vehicle without defects.\nUnfortunately, I cannot currently recommend Audi or this dealer. It seems that immature vehicles are deliberately sold – with all the consequences for the end customer.\nMy trust in Audi is currently zero. When switching from another premium brand with three letters, I had significantly higher expectations. Instead of a premium experience, I experienced a rude collision with reality.\nIf anyone is interested in video recordings of the documented defects (also in connection with media publication), I would be happy to provide them upon request.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Petr Hasalík","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2291,"business_name":"Porsche Inter Auto - Graz Kärntnerstraße 234","business_type":"car dealership","address":"Kärntner Str. 234, 8054 Graz, Austria","city":"Graz","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"050 591 144","website":"https://www.porscheinterauto.at/kontakt/porsche-graz-karntnerstrasse-234","google_rating":"4.3","google_reviews_count":248,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:48:33.292Z","worst_review_text":"An appointment was scheduled for a repair and to address other issues.

I ordered two coffees and two cinnamon rolls, expecting something soft and fresh like the cinnamon rolls I usually get in my country or other places I visit as a tourist.\n\nI saw one cinnamon roll on the counter with other cakes, so I assumed we would receive the order right away. No one informed me that I would have to wait 15 minutes for the roll, or that it wasn’t freshly baked but frozen. When it finally arrived, the kids were excited—it looked nice with frosting and some fruit on top. But the moment we took the first bite, we realized it was hard as a rock and very dry—impossible to cut with a fork.\n\nTo me, it felt like a three-day-old pastry that had just been reheated and topped with fresh frosting. I wanted to say something right away, but there was a long queue at the bar. I didn’t want my kids to eat it, but they were too hungry so they ate half of each. When I eventually spoke to the staff, they told me the roll wasn’t old—it had been baked, frozen, and possibly overheated. They offered another cake as compensation, but we didn’t have time and didn’t want anything else to eat after that so we left.\nSince we paid 17 euros for two coffees and two cinnamon rolls, I felt I had to share this experience for future customers. And to the manager and staff: I’m not here to teach you how to handle these situations, but the least you could’ve done was cancel the order and offer a refund.\n\nAlso, let’s be honest: a reheated cinnamon roll can never compare to a freshly baked one. I wonder—have you ever actually tried the cinnamon roll you’re selling for 4.5 euros? If you want to serve it this way, maybe consider half-baking it and finishing it fresh for each order. But most importantly, customers should be informed that it’s not fresh and that it requires time to be reheated.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Anka Nižetić","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2272,"business_name":"Fielmann","business_type":"optician","address":"Europark, Europark Salzburg, Europastraße 1, 5020 Salzburg, Austria","city":"Salzburg","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0662 420835","website":"https://www.fielmann.at/0703","google_rating":"4.5","google_reviews_count":341,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:48:27.462Z","worst_review_text":"Incompetent.

Normally one would put together another table for 3 people having brunch, but since the tables are bolted, it's not the best way to have a meal all together.\nI'm from Italy and when asking if the panino with prosciutto was with a prosciutto like jamon serrano, the reply from the waitress was that it was raw bacon. Not the best wat to explain it.\nThe waitress also sat down at our table at a certain point while taking our order and that was a new thing...\nWe ordered the ham and cheese panino, the dolce vita breakfast, the Sacher, and the tiramisu.\n\nThe tiramisu was too sweet and heavy, the cream was supposed to be more fluffy than what was presented. I also think the fridge it was kept in altered the smell of the tiramisu so it was not the best.\nThe dolce vita meal had a butter Croissant, butter, jam, a chocolate cake with cream and some fruit. The fruit was in a big shot glass and was not a lot and didn't feel super fresh. The single croissant was nice with some added jam but I ended up ordering some bread for the butter and jam as that made more sense.\n\nThe Sacher cake was good but a bit dry and the mam and cheese toast  was warm but the cheese didn't get the time to melt as the slices were still seperate in the cross section of the toast.\nIn conclusion, I feel that a lot of things can be done to make the experience better, I hope there will be more improvements.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Ernesta Mensah","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":2259,"business_name":"Café N°5 Salzburg","business_type":"coffee shop","address":"Universitätspl. 15, 5020 Salzburg, Austria","city":"Salzburg","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"0660 5257670","website":"http://www.cafeno5-salzburg.at/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":518,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:48:22.793Z","worst_review_text":"We were planning to order, but ended up leaving due to the service.

café itself is undeniably beautiful, with a charming atmosphere and an impressive display of cakes. At first glance, it looks like the perfect spot. Unfortunately, the reality does not match the appearance.\n\nThe cakes, although visually appealing, were extremely dry, dense, and not moist at all, far from the quality one would expect. The bruschetta was also very disappointing: just a slice of bread with chopped tomatoes on top, not even toasted.\n\nThe service was, unfortunately, one of the worst parts of the visit. If you are not from here, do not trust the positive reviews. The staff was very unfriendly and unhelpful. When they did not understand what we wanted, they sighed loudly and made us show photos of the cakes instead of simply allowing us to point to them in the display. When we tried to describe the cake, the staff refused, saying they only accept orders by the exact name. Even then, when they didn’t understand the name, they eventually allowed us to point, but only after much insistence. To add to this, when ordering bruschetta, the staff corrected our pronunciation. This was ironic since we are descendants of Italians and know the correct pronunciation, which makes us wonder how other guests might be treated if they happen to pronounce something differently.\n\nIt is also important to note that the café was almost empty at the time of our visit, with only three other tables occupied besides ours. We were there before 9 a.m., so the poor service cannot be explained by the place being busy or overwhelmed. And even if the café had been full, that would not excuse the lack of courtesy and professionalism we experienced.\n\nOverall, while the setting of Kaffeehaus Riquet is beautiful, the food is of very poor quality and the service is unwelcoming at best. A disappointing experience that we would not recommend.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Patrícia","ai_response_draft":"That service you described is unacceptable - correcting pronunciation and making you show photos instead of pointing is just rude.

I'm actually going to use it as a case study on bad app design.\n\nIt forces you to give all your bank details to book a 'free' sample session, and agree to the terms which don't load, but you have to agree to an empty page of terms to proceed (illegal). Then you must book in the app, which has a setting for English, but it only half works, so it is in some (bad) english and danish.  When I try to do anything in the app, it gives me a pop up message in danish which then disappears after a few seconds, so i can't translate it.\nAbsolutely useless.   It tells me that I'm on a waiting list of 9.  What does this mean? Does it mean that I have to wait for 9 people to not turn up before I get a place? Will I be notified? Why would it let me book if there are already 9 people waiting for a class?  It tells me I'm on a wait list, but also that I'll be charged if i don't attend and when I try to cancel the session, something in danish pops up then disappears after a few seconds.\n\nOf course I've tried to call, but cannot get through.  The person that I spoke to previously wouldn't let me book over the phone, she insisted that I use this terrible app, and now I have it has all my bank details, is warning me that I'll get charged for something that I can't attend.

The miscommunication and lack of proper oversight significantly impacted my experience.\n\nUpdate:\nI initially reached out via email to express my concerns. In response, they called me and asked, \"What do you want us to do?\" They also suggested that \"perhaps the miscommunication was the reason the original physiotherapist’s contract wasn’t extended.\"\n\nFollowing my six-week checkup, I sent a follow-up email asking whether they believed my initial recovery plan had been appropriate and if the care I received met the expected standards.

The morning started with me dropping my dogs off for a groom and some annual shots, to which one of my dogs got nervous and pooped in the floor. I asked the young lady that was a student for something to pick it up with and was given tissues. As I was going to place the tissue filled with poop in the public toilet I was told not to do so and was given the office trash can to place the waste in. To my surprise when I was there to pick my dogs up this evening and pay, why do I see a “Biohazard Waste Fee”! I’m the one that cleaned up behind my dog and was given the office’s trash can to throw it away in!!! Mind you there was a pile of old dog poo right in front of the front door of the establishment (that was not left by my dogs as I don’t do that) that was there from the time I dropped my dogs off that morning to the time I picked them up!!!\n\nAlso I was charged a $7 medication fee for giving my dog insulin which she did NOT receive, as per the evening staff, she didn’t eat her food (which they threw away). So my dog went all day without her needed insulin. Now I ask, would you do this to your kids, grandparents, or even your own beloved pets? Cherry on top, my diabetic dog threw up slimy phlegm and then drank multiple bowls of water as soon as we got home.\n\nTo the doctors at Red Mountain Animal Clinic, please ask your staff to practice more empathy and care, as your vet hold people’s precious animals in your care.

If I could give this clinic zero stars, I would. PLEASE READ\n\nFor 2 years, our dog had multiple symptoms that led us to believe that something was wrong. We took him to appointment after appointment trying to get to the bottom of it and Dr. Schwartz repeatedly dismissed our concerns, telling us that our dog was \"just old\". Our dog turned 10 this year and became sicker than we had ever seen him. Again, Dr. Schwartz dismissed our concerns and prescribed an antibiotic to our dog without even seeing him in person. Because our dog's symptoms were so severe, we chose to get a second opinion and found out that our dog had Stage 4 Spleen Cancer. Because the cancer was detected so late, he could not be saved. Our dog died in our arms this past weekend and our hearts are broken.

Eleven days after the order, I finally was able to get in touch with a customer service rep (forget chatting online even though that is an offered method of contact - after initiating a chat, it always says no one is available). Barbara was very customer service friendly and that was appreciated. I explained I wanted to cancel the order due to delayed shipping and need of item in 3 days. She advised she could not cancel the order but would send it to the shipping dept. - NOPE I have already had a processed payment, waited 11 days on an item - I am not waiting to receive the order and then having to go through the hassle of return shipping since Nordstroms sold me an in stock item that they could not fulfill/deliver.

It was new year’s eve at 6pm ish, so our usual vets was closed and not taking any calls.\nThe receptionist was rude and fear mongering. she recommended Arlo get seen immediately despite being completely fine other than diarrhoea. I told her he’s a very anxious cat and bringing him in might just make him worse, she had none of it and firmly suggested we get him in immediately for examination. I was honest and mentioned we didn’t have a way of bringing him in, she was dismissive and suggested getting a taxi. A consultation alone was expensive, nevermind medication they might prescribe, a taxi on top of that is just not something we could afford, she was completely dismissive of this. I told her I would discuss this and call back ans she was quite rude about this and seemingly disapproved.\nWe then managed to get a call back from our usual vets which was reassuring, and they reassured us completely that for an anxious cat this can sometimes be normal and the fact he had no other symptoms they weren’t worried at all and unless he started throwing up or had excessive diarrhoea there was nothing to worry about. This was the complete opposite of what this vet said and I believe it is purely due to being so money focused having read other reviews. Two days later Arlo was back to his normal self completely. This vets caused so much unnecessary worry for our family and they did not have any sympathy for our situation or even for little anxious Arlo, which i’m sure now would have been terrified going to a new place for no reason at all.\nHaving read other reviews regarding money grabbing and general negligence, I would never ever take any of my pets here and i’d suggest you do the same.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"kg","ai_response_draft":"That call didn't go how it should have and I'm sorry we added stress when you were already worried about Arlo.

As many pet owners know, a murmur can be an early warning sign of heart disease, and early referral to a cardiologist can make a meaningful difference. Unfortunately, Dr. Lemay never recommended a cardiology referral at that stage. Instead, we waited until my dog was already in heart failure before a referral was finally made; long after she could have been evaluated for early-intervention medications that might have helped delay the progression.\n\nThroughout the months that followed, I often felt dismissed when I asked questions or expressed concerns. Any time I asked something heart-related, I was met with, “I’m not a vet cardiologist, so I cannot answer your heart questions,” delivered in a tone that made me reluctant to ask anything further. Because of that, during appointments I only brought up issues unrelated to her heart; not because I was in denial, but because I was trying to respect the boundaries she set.\n\nOne appointment stands out clearly: I brought my dog in because I suspected an upper respiratory issue (she was later diagnosed with asthma). Dr. Lemay looked at me and said, “You know what I think? I think you’re in denial that your dog is in heart failure.” It was one of the most hurtful comments I have ever heard from a veterinarian.\n\nI was not in denial, I was living in constant panic, managing an exhaustive medication regimen (Flovent inhaler, Hydrocodone, Prednisone, nausea meds, Torsemide, Sildenafil, Spironolactone, Benazepril, Vetmedin, vitamins, and more), monitoring her symptoms 24/7, and doing everything in my power to keep her comfortable. I rarely slept. I never left her alone. I even risked my job once by bringing her to work because I refused to let her struggle without me. The suggestion that I was somehow ignoring her condition was not only inaccurate, it was cruel.\n\nThat comment, combined with the lack of early referral and the overall dismissiveness, was the moment I knew I could no longer bring my dog back to Manchester Animal Hospital. I needed compassionate, proactive care, and unfortunately, I did not receive that here.\n\nI wish I could write a different review. I wish this experience had been supportive, collaborative, and respectful. But it wasn’t, and sharing this is the only way I can help other pet owners advocate for their companions.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Melissa Drew","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1921,"business_name":"Fox Creek Veterinary Hospital at Manchester Avenue","business_type":"veterinary clinic","address":"14309 Manchester Rd, Manchester, MO 63011, USA","city":"Manchester","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(636) 458-6569","website":"https://www.foxcreekveterinaryhospital.com/manchester-road-mo/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":449,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:44:49.190Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1919,"business_name":"Animal Health Clinic","business_type":"veterinary clinic","address":"1722 Hillsboro Blvd, Manchester, TN 37355, USA","city":"Manchester","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(931) 728-6633","website":"https://animalhealthvet.com/","google_rating":"4.8","google_reviews_count":557,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:44:48.961Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1917,"business_name":"Veterinary Emergency Center of Manchester","business_type":"veterinary clinic","address":"2743 Brown Ave, Manchester, NH 03103, USA","city":"Manchester","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(603) 666-6677","website":"http://www.vecmnh.com/","google_rating":"3.9","google_reviews_count":554,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:44:48.726Z","worst_review_text":"We brought our cat in due to some breathing issues she was having. We were there for almost 12 hours (see picture of check in time and discharge instructions time…I am unfortunately not exaggerating). They were severely understaffed it seems, as from what I could tell there was only a single vet on staff. And while I understand that is not their fault, I wish they provided better communication.\n\nAfter being checked in at about 6:30pm, it took an hour or so to get into triage. After triage we were in the lobby until 11pm, which at that point the girl at the desk offered us a room so our cat could stretch her legs. We did not have any contact again from anyone at all up until 1:30am. The vet tech that came in listened to her breathing and bumped her up the list. The vet did not come in the room until 3:30am. At that time our cat was taken back for testing and diagnostics, which I understand takes awhile. The vet wrapped up with us around 5:30am.\n\nI understand this is an emergency vet, and since our cat’s vitals were stable, she kept getting bumped down the list when critical emergencies came in. But hours went by without any contact, recheck, or communication.\n\nI am giving 2 stars because the vet, Erica White, was indeed great. But the rest of the experience was not great.

Told her she would hear from me through my insurance and lawyer. I arrived little late and I apologized for the delay. I also informed her of the accident that morning. She wrote a report and told me to see neurosurgeon as soon as possible since I had neck and shoulder surgery 2 years ago if not it would lead to paralysis after accident. I made an appointment with my neurosurgeon he’s on holiday vacation until January the first week. I’m cautious about the possibility of a balance and fall. I begin to notice that I have dizziness. I will go to the hospital near Orlando if getting worse. I don’t live in Chicago but I’m a Florida resident!! Accident happened in Trinity, Florida at 6:23 AM because of SafePilot and photos that showed up the location of the accident and the time!! I told several professionals that you DENIED to take my case. Florida lawyers at Disparti are one of my favorites and you WANTED me to find another lawyer. Not one of other lawyers besides Disparti!  I thought I would help you make money against the driver and she was on the phone while driving!! Nice of you denied taking my case even though she has a different insurance company. I thought I would depend on you and your handling the car accident and my injury. Now I am disgusted, disappointed and beyond my shock at the time of the accident. I feel very discouraged and rejected by you!! I am not going to find another lawyer that sure wastes my time. Disparti is located in New Port Richey area. I spoke to sheriff about the accident and he said since traffic that morning would delay at least an hour, he was pleased that we weren’t arguing about the accident. Oddly, the driver and I live in the same city driving towards Tampa!! I like the sheriff for his time to talk to me, he looked at my car and said it looked pretty bad especially the door that can’t open. I have panic attacks since the accident, I worry about driving! I saw my daughter who is a head registered nurse and explained my symptoms and anxiety to her. She couldn’t understand why you rejected me.  I am not going into the details.

Later, during treatment for Giardia, they kept performing unnecessary and premature tests and kept her on medication much longer than needed. A second opinion from another vet confirmed this and helped resolve the issue properly.\n\nMost recently, when we went back for Ellie’s annual vaccinations, we were told we couldn’t be seen because we hadn’t followed “compliance” on the Giardia case — even though we had completed treatment with another licensed vet. We were told to bring proof, which we did — both printed and emailed. Despite that, we were refused service again and spoken to rudely and dismissively by the staff.\n\nIt’s one thing to make a medical mistake; it’s another to treat customers disrespectfully and refuse service after they’ve followed instructions.

The office staff and Dr. Burns are unbelievably rude and uncaring.  I have 3 dogs and our new puppy got very sick after getting a vaccine there yesterday. I called asking to bring him in as he had non stop diarrhea and vomiting.  He wouldn’t drink or eat. I asked if we could bring him in for fluids and anti nausea meds, they said they’d call me back.  They didn’t so I called them and was placed on eternal hold.  Then told they’d call me back again.  I told them that he was very weak and needed help.  She refused to have him come in & hung up on me.  I called back 2 more times and was hung up on. I expressed my displeasure on how they were treating a long time customer with a sick puppy from a vaccine they had given the previous afternoon. Dr. Burns called, accused me of swearing, told me the calls had been recorded, wouldn’t let me speak and threatened to prevent me from being a client there.  She lied!  I never swore! She actually said that she was trying to help, when in fact they didn’t call back, didn’t offer to see him or treat him. She and her staff are liars, she actually said I that her staff said I don’t want treatment.  Why would I call and ask to bring my dog in twice for treatment?  Obviously they are liars! They don’t care about you furry family, and have horrible customer service.  I have been going there since 2011 - we love Dr. Keri, but the practice has gone down hill.  You can’t be seen when your pet is sick and have to go to the ER. What’s the point of having them as a vet? they have too many clients and too few doctors.  Dr. Burns is horrible!!!!  I am getting my records and going to find a new vet!  Beware!

So for me to even give $20 after below average service was alot for me. The massage was very mid. It felt like auto pilot she was repeating the same motion and not adjusting to some of my tense areas that needed more attention because my back been tense all week from my workouts. Half way during massage I just wanted it to end already. With that being said maybe it’s her first time w me so whatever. As I’m walking out I gave her $20 and she gave me a nasty look and said “that’s it?” “You can’t give $10 more?” “Usually 90mins is atleast $30 for tip” and I was like what?! First of all that’s really rude! Then I told her “trust me I usually give at least $40 tip for 90min service but I wasn’t happy w your massage” she same something under her breath then walked away and didn’t even say “thank you” or “have a good day” or anything.

I took my old cat to revision because I noticed he was acting weird. After being seen and taken a blood and urine samples on Monday, the laboratory called me on Wednesday to communicate the cat has thyroid and I had to collect medication for him. I went same day and I gave the cat his medication. However he didn't improve not even a little, so I called to the emergency number, on Thursday morning, explained the situation, and I asked for an appointment for a same day as  matter of urgency. The kid that was at the phone said that wasn't possible, and he only offered me a vet call next day evening, also I had to paid for the consultation. Sadly during the night I had to see how the cat suffer, and I see him exhale Friday morning. He suffered, he couldn't find peace that night. I feel responsible but I really would have appreciate if someone have heard that was an emergency. I explained the cat wasn't look good at all, and I was worried, and I need it a vet appointment. Also I believe the cat didn't get the right diagnosis from first day and then their \"emergency number \"clearly doesn't know what's an emergency. I just wanted to prevent people and get a second vet opinion if you belive your pet is sick and don't trust completely their first diagnosis. I truly thought they knew, and i trusted but I am sure the cat has more conditions, not only the thiroid.

I specifically asked office manager Corey why they would charge $188 for initial diagnostic, and whether it was simply connecting their diagnostic scanner, and I was told that they spend time with the car, and that it's much more than simply reading the scanner. After walking around for an hour, I came back to see they hadn't moved the car into the bay, and I went for another walk about.  After 45 more minutes I received text alert from them that the car is \"all set\" and a picture of the scanner with an alert message was included. I walked back to find the car in the same exact spot (I had marked the spot) and was told that the repair would cost between $1500-2000!! They charged $188 for connecting the scanner and sending me a picture of it. That's it, probably took them 5 -10 minutes. They hadn't moved the car one inch and kept me walking around for nearly 2 hours to justify the rip-off fee they charge for diagnosis.  It's a scam, and they're liars and cheats! I don't know if they're good mechanics or not, but I know they're untrustworthy and should be avoided.  Your local repair shop, gas station mechanic has the same device and will likely give you the diagnostic reading at no, or very little, charge. Buyer beware!\n\nPS The issue with the car is stability control program (ESP) and even the dealer charges $800-1000 to fix it, not $1500-2000. A recent alignment may have caused the sensor to be malfunctioning and may be corrected by re-doing the alignment.  Will report back.  Either way, lesson learned. $188 cost to avoid falling into a much bigger trap at Ming's Auto.

The one girl advised they don’t take wildlife and expected me to leave with this raccoon with no further info.  I asked her if they’ve ever taken wildlife before and she said yes, I then again told her I called and was advised by multiple places to bring to this vet. She tried again to turn me away and said sorry can’t help you.\n\nIt wasn’t only until I pushed back further she decided to go and check in back with someone. She then sauntered back over to me and said okay we can take him.  Absolutely unacceptable. This poor animal!\n\nAt this point I was pretty upset and said this is ridiculous that you would turn me away.  Then the other girl started chiming in and said a phone call to LACC for consent was required and they were all of a sudden well versed in the process to admit the animal.  When I asked them why they didn’t just do this in the beginning instead of going back and forth for 10 min and trying to get me to leave, they said there was a breakdown in communication.\n\nAs an EMERGENCY vet the front staff should be doing everything in their power to HELP not turn people with their animals away.  Especially animals that are severely suffering, wild or not.\n\nI hope the facility manager sees this and contacts me if further information required.\n\nThe lady who did help from the back, I think her name was Jenn?

That's if you can find a member of staff to help you.\nThey simply process your purchase and that's it. You might as well buy online, with that level of service.\n\nThe food is overpriced and nothing special. You can't find a seat in the affordable mcdonald's. If you're wealthy or are having and extravagant day, you will probably find somewhere good to eat. Otherwise go to the Wetherspoon across road or bring in your KFC.\n\nThe shopping experience is not as enjoyable as it used to be. But this is not down to Westfield, but the retailers.\n\nPrimark and John Lewis are the stars of Westfield.

Due to this and the lack of cleanliness in the restaurant, I decided to speak to the cashier.\nThe answer I received was, they were short staffed and she requested me to complain on the first floor at customer services, which is what I did.\nWe went along to the first floor and spoke to a man who said he will pass on my complaint to the manager the next day, when he was in. Who knows if this was passed on and actioned.\n\nIt was very disappointing that there seemed to be enough catering staff on the counter areas but not enough staff on the floor to clear up.

I went in a few days ago as a Type 1 Diabetic having an emergency hypoglycemic episode and uncontrollably throwing up. If this is the only line you read, DO NOT GO SEE PAC YEN LUU. When I arrived there was no sense of urgency nor a care in the world. I was waiting for about 10-15 minutes to been seen, which seems like a short time, however when you’re hypoglycemic there needs to be more urgency. The PA decided I needed glucose gel, however she had no idea if they had it in clinic nor any other glucose available. Ridiculous for an immediate care to have “nothing.” She eventually found a source of glucose and administered it, then called 911 after I asked her not to on 3 separate occasions since I knew I just needed glucose. She called anyway and I respected her medical opinion.

I tried to move past it and just focus on what’s going on in the moment. She was acting with NO sense of urgency whatsoever. Even the EMTs got snappy with her to do her job faster. She didn’t know how to print a report and instead of trying to figure it out, she stood in the doorway of my clinical room. Literally just standing.

I did however have a friend that wanted to join me for a workout that day and just negative and awkward experience. “No you don’t have guest privileges” then walks away and tells the sales person. Even though I was told I did when I initially signed up. Apparently I just have VIP guest and they have to live in AZ to come along to my surprise. There’s just a way to handle people when they step into your house of business and I didn’t feel welcomed or taken care of at all. Hate this is the most convenient one to me bc it’s just going to be weird going forward. Please just take the day off if you can’t show up with a positive and helpful attitude bc it shows and makes a difference in client experience. I’ll be touching base with the gym I signed up with to speak about the type of membership I did get.

you are a homeowner considering working with Colorado RPM for their rental management services please reconsider. Over the one year they managed my rental property the following happened:\n- Delayed communication\n- I was charged $150 for a plumber who found nothing wrong with a toilet the tenants claimed was not working.\n- I was informed the current tenants decided not to renew their lease 23 days before the lease ended. Tenants are contractually obligated to communicate their intention not to renew 60-days prior.\n- The tenants moved out after one year and the house was filthy, the carpet needed to be replaced, there was a couch in the garage, the yard was overgrown with weeds and appeared to have not been tended to at all during the emote year.\n- After leaving the house in this manner they told me the cost for having the lock box picked up was $45 and if I wanted to keep it was $30.\n\nWhat tenants do and do not do cannot be controlled, but if the tenants do not comply with the rules they set forth in the lease it is the company's responsibility. At least don't charge me $45 for a lockbox pick up. Customer service!\n\nAddition as of 7/08/2025\nAs per CRPM's response to this review, the photos speak for themselves. This is the state in which the house was returned to me after only one year. It is costing me nearly $6000 to remove junk, landscape and deep clean to the property's previous condition.\n\nPlease read other reviews on google, Yelp and the better business bureau to get a fuller picture. My pain points are shared by many others.\n\nI am not a business professional. However, common courtesy and common sense go a long way. You do not have to have an MBA to know that the way to mitigate a situation like this is to 1 - acknowledge a mistake was made, 2 - take responsibility for the mistake and 3 - apologize/compensate.  Continuing to antagonize an unhappy customer by getting defensive and justifying mistakes online is not good business or good common sense. Also, pointing out that charging $30 for a lockbox is \"standard protocol\" when I've shared pictures of a house that will cost approximately $6000 to bring back to pre-tenant condition demonstrates the stinginess of this business. A wise and savvy business would offer this nominal voucher to the client as an apology. Because losing $30 will not break the bank for this business. But, losing multiple potential future clients due to a bad review and a defensive response could result in thousands of dollars of revenue in the long term.

I pay for the more expensive membership so I can swim.  When you get out of the pool soaking wet and cold, you need a hot shower.  But once again there was no hot water this morning.  I told the front desk staff who made the same excuses I've heard before (the gym was busy and the hot water heaters can't keep up).  Well it wasn't as busy as it can easily get and instead of making excuses, why not get water heaters, or a system, that can keep up with demand?  Or stop selling memberships until you can keep enough hot water for your members who are already paying??  And yesterday's shower fun was having to pick up a big wad of hair that was clogging the drain and throw it away.  All the other showers were full so no chance to move.\n\nEarlier review from December:\n\nI left my last gym because they were not taking care of the equipment.  At first Chuze was good about this, but now this gym has gone way downhill (writing this in December 2025).  I routinely point out bikes that do not work, where the lever that tightly closes on the handlebars and seats and keeps them in place has gotten weak and no longer snaps into place.  This is so dangerous as I have had a bike part collapse on me before and I was injured.  At best, it’s annoying for the seat and handlebars to rock back and forth all through your workout.  These bikes do NOT get fixed, but sometimes get moved around.  The accessible shower in the women’s locker room was out of commission for months, only got fixed for a short time and is now unavailable again.  There are already lines for the shower; just imagine when January hits!  One of the shower heads is broken, another shower has a valve that doesn’t tightly close so water drips out, and some shower doors are broken with sharp edges.  Sometimes you get hot water, other times you don’t (for weeks at a time).  The blow dryers that are broken don’t get replaced for weeks.  About half of the lockers are out of order.  This is so unacceptable when theft is a big problem at this gym.  I’ve had 3 friends get their stuff stolen from the locker room.  When I point out all these problems to staff, I’m told that they already put a work order in for that thing or that management won’t pay for the necessary repairs.  Even when I point out bikes that don’t work to the maintenance man, they don’t get fixed.  They had a weight tower on the turf floor with smaller weights and weights in small increments: 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. pounds.  These were regularly used by people like me doing physical therapy and general exercises.  I came in one day recently and they were gone!  Replaced by a smaller set of weights at 5, 7.5, 10, etc. pounds.  The exact same weights that you can already get along the weight wall.  I begged to get the smaller weights back to continue to do my PT, but were told they were “gone”.  A lot of people used these so for them to disappear was totally frustrating!  And now the TVs that line the entire gym have things on like the Flintstones and never-ending infomercials!  I asked a couple days ago if the TV near me could be put on the news, but was told they weren’t showing news anymore to not offend anyone!  Well, having to watch an informercial or the Flintstones for 30 minutes to an hour is MORE annoying!!  This is an adult gym, why can’t we have news programs on??  Soon all the people with their New Year’s resolutions will descend on the gym, and the problems already plaguing members will get worse!!  Management, get with it and fix this gym!!  I would NOT recommend this gym.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Brenda Walker","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1684,"business_name":"24 Hour Fitness","business_type":"gym","address":"Colorado Plaza, 4120 E Alameda Ave, Denver, CO 80246, USA","city":"Denver","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(303) 377-4424","website":"https://www.24hourfitness.com/gyms/denver-co/alameda-ave-denver-sport?Adb_id=GGL_LOC_ACQ_CDP","google_rating":"3.8","google_reviews_count":990,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:40:30.042Z","worst_review_text":"The dirtiest/stinkiest gym I’ve ever been to and the worst 24 Hour Fitness location in the Denver area by far.\n\nAddendum: I have went ahead and added some photographs of the facilities, which look like a prison.

Yeah right.\n\nHands down the worst care I have ever received from a doctor. I had a complex gender-affirming surgery that resulted in two complications, both very slow to heal wounds and a MRSA infection. I wasn't getting adequate follow-up care with my surgery team, so I reached out to my PCP at Cap Hill Medical for a referral to a wound healing center. My PCP blocked every effort I made to get this referral. First he said that insurance wouldn't cover a second opinion. Then, when I called insurance and verified that it would be covered, he continued to ignore my request for a referral, reiterating that I should seek advice from my surgery team and \"ask to speak to the surgeon.\" I wouldn't have been asking for a second opinion if my surgery team had provided decent care. My surgeon was utterly unavailable, literally never even in the same building. After two weeks of back and forth, I finally gave up and went to a Zoomcare, where they provided the referral and honestly seemed dismayed that my wounds had gone so long untreated.\n\nAdditionally, I needed regular labs done for my hormone levels and had done so every six months through Cap Hill medical. In January, as a fun surprise, my PCP added vitamin D testing to my panel without asking my consent, resulting in a $306 uncovered charge. He never apologized. I am still going back and forth with insurance and Labcorp to resolve it, 11 months later.\n\nI prefer to give feedback directly rather than just posting reviews. I shared all of this feedback with my PCP, but never received an apology, or even a response.\n\nMy wife was loyal to Cap Hill Medical for years and has always spoken highly of Dr. Rongisch.

I know this isn't their fault but I dont have time to sit on the phone while someone is trying to learn the language./ C. This place is not clean, it's very rundown/ and D. It takes FOREVER to get an appt! The staff has always been pleasant tho, so 2 stars for that.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Amy Fleck","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1675,"business_name":"Virginia Mason Medical Center","business_type":"medical clinic","address":"1100 9th Ave, Seattle, WA 98101, USA","city":"Seattle","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(206) 624-1144","website":"https://www.vmfh.org/our-hospitals/virginia-mason-medical-center.html","google_rating":"3.8","google_reviews_count":874,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:40:27.143Z","worst_review_text":"The medical providers I have worked with for over 10 years have been great. The Neurologists are have been quite good and the nurses at the infusion center are my absolute favorite thing about receiving care here (they'd get 5 stars if I were only rating them). My issues is with the billing department. I have been dealing with the billing department here for the 10+ years that I've been going here. They make having a chronic illness even worse than it already is. Just dealing with their ineptitude is like having a second full-time job. There was one, ONE, blissful year that a saint worked in the billing department that made sure my account was handled correctly. I am part of a financial assistance program through the pharmaceutical company that provides the drug I need for MS and every month (except the 12 aforementioned blissful ones) I have had to call and make sure they send the post-insurance remainder to Biogen, and every month they don't do it. Which eventually leads me to being sent to collections, which then leads me to reaching out to Biogen (who has been excellent BTW) to confirm that I didn't somehow get kicked out of their financial assistance program and confirm that Virginia Mason hasn't filed a claim with them, which then leads me to calling Virginia Mason Billing to ask them to file a claim with Biogen....which may or may not happen by the time the next invoice rolls around. And repeat that over and over again every month for 10 years. Oh and the newest thing is that I'm still getting multiple thousands of dollars invoices but Biogen has sent them the checks, they've cashed them and they are still invoicing me saying it hasn't been paid AND sending me to collections! Then they ask me to just be patient. Also, since they were bought by the religious health organization \"Franciscan Health\" things have only gotten worse. You can't email billing anymore, you can only call, meaning you have to use more time out of your workday to sort out what someone else does for their full-time job. The only reason I haven't switched to is because of how much more work it would be to transfer care....but I'm close.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Mariya Burke","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1674,"business_name":"Carolyn Downs Family Medical","business_type":"medical clinic","address":"2101 E Yesler Wy # 150, Seattle, WA 98122, USA","city":"Seattle","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(206) 299-1900","website":"https://seattleroots.org/clinic/carolyn-downs-family-medical-center","google_rating":"4.3","google_reviews_count":60,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:40:26.871Z","worst_review_text":"Seattle Roots Community Health organization took advantage of me as a TENANT/PATIENT by violating my rights to patient safety, access to official and patient-centered complaint process, by subjecting me repeatedly to inappropriate non-consensual hugging and touching by a DOCTOR and other  misconduct that has caused immense predictable harm.\n\nHealthcare workers are among the most important people in our societies and fill a roll that demands unrelenting ethical commitment to SAFETY, BOUNDARIES AND STANDARDS.\n\nThis organization has failed at that and caused me awful emotional, physical and psychological harm.\n\nAnd they have not taken responsibility AT ALL for their glaring missteps and mistreatment of a vulnerable PATIENT/TENANT.\n\nDisgusting conduct from a ‘medical physician’.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Jamie E","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1673,"business_name":"Harborview Medical Center","business_type":"medical clinic","address":"325 9th Ave Main Hospital, Seattle, WA 98104, USA","city":"Seattle","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(206) 744-3000","website":"https://www.uwmedicine.org/locations/harborview-medical-center?utm_source=extnet&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website_clicks&y_source=1_MTAwNDcxNDM0Ni03MTUtbG9jYXRpb24ud2Vic2l0ZQ%3D%3D","google_rating":"3.6","google_reviews_count":857,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:40:26.655Z","worst_review_text":"Absolutely the worst patient service I've ever seen.

here today on a guest pass. I was planning on signing up for a membership after today’s visit. Unfortunately, there are quite a few aspects that need improving before I’d do so.\n\nPositives:\n-The two staff members working at reception were very friendly and helpful.\n-I loved the layout of the weights areas with semi-private “alcoves” to work out in.\n-The old school, industrial architecture and exposed brick is very cool.\n-The whole facility is very spacious and didn’t feel crowded at all despite quite a few people being there.\n\nAreas for improvement:\n-The men’s sauna (one of the main reasons I’d want to join) was barely warm due to the poorly installed glass door that has a large gap.

Getting an appointment that isn't two months out is terrible enough but after waiting the two months to be seen and the staff messing up the appointment that turns out was \"never made\" is just pathetic. They need to get organized and find people who really want to be there and do their job. Non-profit, fine, but at the end of the day they're there racking up points for their resume. This is just not fair to the patients.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Pineapple

ongoing construction project at the men’s bathroom/locker room has been a complete mess. Why is the shower room still open for use while you have workers there replacing the lockers constantly in and out of there? You end up having 5 naked men coming out of shower waiting to get to their lockers, blocking the ways for other members just coming in. And everyone is looking for available lockers like doing some obstacle courses, trying not to bump into someone’s naked ass or interrupt whoever others they are socializing when they are un/dressing. Please Close the shower room until you have the locker room completely ready.\n\nAnd the combination lockers are huge disappointment, they are so prone to theft and people easily forget about their codes. And you can’t easily identify which ones are being used or not. Also put some sort of instructions for use for gods sake and some area numbers like 1-40, 40- 80 etc, in set areas on the wall or something.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Zak D","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1631,"business_name":"Mission Cliffs","business_type":"gym","address":"2295 Harrison St, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA","city":"San Francisco","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(415) 550-0515","website":"http://www.touchstoneclimbing.com/mission-cliffs","google_rating":"4.6","google_reviews_count":819,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:40:12.391Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1630,"business_name":"Live Fit Gym • Hayes Valley","business_type":"gym","address":"301 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102, USA","city":"San Francisco","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(415) 525-4364","website":"http://www.livefitgym.com/","google_rating":"4.6","google_reviews_count":107,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:40:12.171Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1629,"business_name":"Sunset Gym","business_type":"gym","address":"1247 9th Ave, San Francisco, CA 94122, USA","city":"San Francisco","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(415) 564-1212","website":"http://www.sunset-gym.com/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":168,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:40:11.948Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1628,"business_name":"Crunch Fitness","business_type":"gym","address":"2330 Polk St, San Francisco, CA 94109, USA","city":"San Francisco","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(415) 292-5444","website":"https://www.crunch.com/locations/polk-st","google_rating":"4.0","google_reviews_count":260,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:40:11.726Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1627,"business_name":"FITNESS SF -

The stair-master machines were old, rusty, and dusty, with some damaged buttons.\n\nThe staff member at the front desk was very friendly, but he was the only employee in a facility that clearly needs more staff and constant cleaning. The whole place needs a deep clean and updated equipment.\n\nOverall, the gym gave me the same rundown vibe as the surrounding Tenderloin area.

Unfortunately, although I reminded Briana 3x, this clinic waited until the expiration date to leave me a voicemail saying I needed to seek a specialist to complete the paperwork. Now here we are almost 8 months after my last visit and I’m receiving text messages from the clinic about an unpaid bill. No bill was mailed. No phone calls or voicemails. I called today (July 8, 2025) tried to speak with Briana but she abruptly transferred me to a number without a voicemail & without listening to me. I called back multiple times and finally spoke with Rudy who was brief and didn’t wish to hear me. This by far is the most unprofessional establishment I’ve ever been to.

don’t know how this Planet Fitness is still open, because every time I walk in, it feels like the place has completely given up on even pretending to function. My experiences here have been so unbelievably bad that “disappointment” doesn’t even begin to cover it.\n\nLet’s start with the manager, Jimmy. In my personal experience, he has been one of the rudest, least helpful managers I’ve ever encountered anywhere. Any time I’ve tried to ask a simple question, he acts like I’m inconveniencing him by daring to exist. His attitude alone is enough to make someone want to cancel their membership.\n\nThe filth in this gym is unbelievable. It constantly looks like it hasn’t been properly cleaned in ages. The bathrooms are grimy, the workout areas smell awful, and the equipment is covered in dust and sweat like no one even bothers to wipe anything down. It’s genuinely gross.\n\nAnd speaking of equipment—half the machines seem to be broken at any given time. Not just occasionally. Constantly. For weeks. Cardio machines, weight machines, you name it—there’s always a giant “Out of Order” sign slapped on something. It’s a gym where you can barely work out.\n\nEven worse, there is NO WATER. Not “the fountain was down for a few hours.” No—there have been multiple times I’ve shown up and there was absolutely zero working water available anywhere in the facility. A gym that can’t provide water is unthinkable, yet here we are.\n\nTheir payment system is a joke too. I’ve had several experiences where they couldn’t take cash, credit, anything because their system was down. How does a modern business function like that?\n\nAnd on top of all this, the gym feels completely unmanaged, with people who clearly aren’t members constantly coming in to use the bathrooms, showers, and hang out. The staff seem overwhelmed or uninterested, and the situation feels chaotic and poorly controlled.\n\nIn my experience, this location is an absolute trainwreck from top to bottom. Between the rude management, disgusting facilities, broken machines, no water, and non-stop operational failures, I can confidently say this is the worst gym I’ve ever stepped foot in.\n\nAvoid this place unless you enjoy frustration, filth, and wasting your money.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Tiffany Palioungas","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1601,"business_name":"Barbell Brigade Gym","business_type":"gym","address":"646 Gibbons St, Los Angeles, CA 90031, USA","city":"Los Angeles","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(323) 225-2251","website":"https://www.barbellbrigade.com/","google_rating":"4.7","google_reviews_count":408,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:40:02.840Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1600,"business_name":"EōS Fitness","business_type":"gym","address":"701 W Cesar Estrada Chavez Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90012, USA","city":"Los Angeles","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(213) 528-3132","website":"https://eosfitness.com/gym/los-angeles-downtown-la-cesar-chavez/?utm_source=local&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=evergreen_gmb","google_rating":"3.7","google_reviews_count":1467,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:40:02.615Z","worst_review_text":"EŌS Fitness operates through deception and deliberate lack of disclosure.\nThey market memberships as “all-access,” yet fail to clearly disclose that certain locations are classified as “Luxury” and exclude standard members.

Because I travel frequently for work, I intentionally selected a membership that advertised access to all locations. When I arrived at an EŌS location with my sister (who has the highest-tier membership) and a guest, we were denied entry because the gym was labeled “Luxury.” None of us were clearly informed of this restriction when signing up.\n\nStaff then offered only me a one-time entry, expecting me to leave the people I arrived with—an insulting and unreasonable solution.\n\nThis lack of transparency cost them a potential new member, as our guest was considering switching to EŌS but decided not to after witnessing this experience.\n\nEŌS does not clearly advertise Luxury locations or plans.\nInstead, they rely on small print and vague language to mislead customers into memberships that do not provide the access they expect.

Unfortunately, the staff has consistently come across as rude and unwelcoming. The rude one is the girl with the glasses. She really need to reconsider a new job or get some serious help in customer service. Simple gestures, like saying good morning, are often ignored, which creates an uncomfortable atmosphere.\n\nWhat’s frustrating is that while staff interaction is lacking day-to-day, communication suddenly improves when it comes time to collect membership payments. In comparison to other gyms I’ve visited—where staff are friendly and welcoming—this location falls short in customer service.\n\nAdditionally, members are charged a $20 fee to train on holidays, while non-members pay $25, which feels unreasonable given the lack of service. The only reason I continue to attend is because the hours are convenient.\n\nI hope management considers investing in staff who are courteous, professional, and genuinely interested in providing a positive experience. Improving customer service would greatly enhance the gym and likely benefit the business as well.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Anetra

here on winter break about a month ago to a new hairstylist(bad idea) for a highlight touch up. Amy had done my hair the summer before and did an absolutely fantastic job. She wasn’t available the days I was, so I booked with a stylist that charged the same amount, assuming I’d get the same quality of work. I told they stylist I wanted them a tad lighter. Mind you the highlights were originally like a dark honey blonde. When I said a tad lighter, I meant honey blonde. I didn’t notice how awful they looked until I got home to regular lighting and could see my roots. My hair was literally WHITE and my roots were showing? Why would a stylist completely leave the roots out and not only that, not blend the color to at least make it look good. My roots literally looked burnt. I went to a Sally’s store and had to fix the color and blend the roots myself because when I called to schedule a redo, the snobby front desk lady told me she couldn’t get it redone that week, and NEVER called me back to schedule me in. Absolutely horrendous job and waste of 200 DOLLARS.

I booked here specifically due to a friend going here but I received the WORST haircut of my life from ANNA DALEY.\n\nTo make this as short as possible everything that was done during my “luxury” appointment:\n\n- stylist 10+ minutes late, no notification from the front desk that she would be late. The salon has a late policy which apparently doesn’t apply to stylists\n- she shows up in a hoodie, WITH the hood ON which she left on the entire appointment to cover her 2 inch PLUS roots and dirty/ faded  yoga pants\n- she told me her morning was “rough”. It was 12 in the afternoon? Morning was long gone\n- the ENTIRE appointment, she did not have me facing the mirror. She had me pointed in the direction the entire time to look at another stylist doing hair and did not move me\n- she has me slouch down to cut my hair instead of moving me because she stated she’s “short” I’m only 5’7, hard to believe I would be her tallest client\n- she kept making comments about hair length. Asking me if my hair grows fast and told me to look down and said oh I know it seems like a lot of hair, but it’s not. Then after my haircut was done, she didn’t even do a 360 of my hair. She just pointed me to the side and said look. It’s still towards the middle of your back and she spent more time curling my hair than actually cutting it.\n\nI thought everything was ok and I didn’t think much of my length as she curled my hair pretty strongly. Well after I washed my hair I noticed how she completely ruined my hair. My hair was LONG and she cut off all my hair AND there is no symmetry as you can see from the photos.\n\nI waited a little bit cause maybe I thought oh it’s just in my head, but then I had someone take videos of my hair to realize how bad it was. So I called to make a complaint with management and at first I was pretty lenient cause I understand how things work, but it took over two days to come to a solution. They kept asking me to come in to assess my hair and I’m just like why would I come in? I’m sending you videos and pictures like my hair is extremely uneven. They said they would like to make it up to me by conditioning and I’m like that doesn’t bring my length back? My hair is completely GONE. I told them I wouldn’t want to go back because the only way to fix it is to cut off all my hair and I don’t want it cut so I asked for a refund. The owner of the salon told me that I could not have a refund because it’s part of their policy so I brought up the website and I said OK can you let me know where on your website it states that you don’t give refunds?  She couldn’t. Long story short, she ended up trying to record our conversation which I told her I did not consent to. She ended up giving me a refund AFTER I told her I was going to make a review but ANNA DALEY still kept my $20 tip as I sent it via Venmo.

NOT COME HERE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.\n\nThe short version: this shop pulled a bait-and-switch twice, lied about pricing, and refused to release our car unless we paid more than the agreed quote. The situation escalated to the point where we had to call the police so we could safely leave with our vehicle.\n\nThe full story:\n\nWe live in the neighborhood and have been paying customers of this shop for 3–4 years. Most recently, we brought our car in to replace a side mirror that had been chipped overnight. We spoke directly with the lead mechanic, who explained that the replacement mirror might not be an exact color match but guaranteed—both verbally and on the written quote—that it would be a similar shade. He also said that if the part arrived in a completely different color, it would be sent back. We agreed on a set price.\n\nA few days later, he called to say the mirror arrived and that it was dark silver (our car is white), but told us he would cover the cost of painting it so it would match. We asked multiple times on that call to confirm there would be no additional charge, and he confirmed there would not be.\n\nWhen we arrived to pick up the car, the shop demanded $250 more than the agreed quote, stating that we either had to pay the higher amount or they would remove the mirror and return the car in its original damaged condition. We explained that we had been long-time customers, lived in the neighborhood, and had clear proof of what was agreed to. None of that mattered.\n\nThe lead mechanic refused to involve the owner or management, even though we had a recording of the call confirming the price. He stated that he “couldn’t make $10 on this job” and tried to undo the work instead of honoring the agreement. The situation became so hostile that we had to call the police to supervise the interaction. The mechanic showed up outside of his shift, became aggressive and loud, and had to be calmed down by the police while they waited for us to safely leave the lot.\n\nThis experience showed a complete lack of honesty, accountability, and leadership. There is no clear management presence, no concern for customer service, and no willingness to stand by written or verbal agreements.\n\nAdditionally, we dropped our car off with 1/4 tank of gas left and when we picked it up it was the lowest I've ever seen the tank (well below the empty line).\n\nIf you value transparency, professionalism, or basic trust with your car, do not bring it here.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Jacob","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1557,"business_name":"Brach's Auto Center","business_type":"auto repair shop","address":"10333 S Western Ave, Chicago, IL 60643, USA","city":"Chicago","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(773) 238-0606","website":"https://www.brachsautocenter.com/","google_rating":"4.9","google_reviews_count":939,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:39:00.253Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1556,"business_name":"Midtown Auto Repair- Goodyear","business_type":"auto repair shop","address":"1403 W Shakespeare Ave, Chicago, IL 60614, USA","city":"Chicago","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(773) 832-1300","website":"https://www.midtownautorepair.com/","google_rating":"4.8","google_reviews_count":532,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:38:59.900Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1555,"business_name":"Logan Square Auto Repair","business_type":"auto repair shop","address":"2442 N Milwaukee Ave, Chicago, IL 60647, USA","city":"Chicago","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(773) 772-1639","website":"https://www.logansquareautorepair.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gmb_confluence","google_rating":"4.5","google_reviews_count":379,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:38:59.665Z","worst_review_text":"I took my car in because my battery completely died and they ended up charging me a massive $125 to decontaminate the engine from rodent feces, $185 for an engine diagnostic, and then charged me $105 for an oil change when I initially asked them to top it off.

My vehicle was backed into in September and finally returned today after multiple trips back. At pickup, the hood was misaligned and the bottom bumper scratched. At home, I found additional issues: a cracked aftermarket (AFK) headlight, clear coat drips, and polish/burn marks around the driver-side door. While the burn marks didn’t go through the paint, they still reflected rushed workmanship.\n\nI spoke with the general manager about these concerns, but none were properly communicated to the technicians. I later learned the manager had been terminated, which explains the miscommunication. The CAPA-certified hood didn’t fit properly, and despite multiple corrections, the front hood/bonnet was still scratched at one point before being fixed. Even after everything, the hood alignment was slightly off, and I was told there was nothing more that could be done because it was OEM. I still don’t understand how the shop released my vehicle in that condition—an aftermarket (AFK) headlight was cracked, the paint had issues, and the CAPA-certified hood was misaligned.\n\nMy frustration wasn’t about waiting for parts; it was entirely with the quality of work and having to bring the vehicle back multiple times to address issues that should have been fixed the first time. Communication was extremely poor—I did not receive a single email, text, or phone call with updates, which was especially surprising given that other reviews mentioned regular updates.\n\nIt was also clear the shop seemed frustrated with my follow-ups, but that is not my fault—these issues arose because the work was not completed properly initially.\n\nI’m glad insurance covered the cost, as I would not have wanted to pay for this work myself. While most issues were eventually corrected, the process shows a clear lack of attention to detail and oversight, which is frustrating given the high cost of the repairs.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Julia Cruz","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1553,"business_name":"Chicago Auto Repair","business_type":"auto repair shop","address":"1710 W Chicago Ave, Chicago, IL 60622, USA","city":"Chicago","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(888) 212-3192","website":"http://chicagoautorep.com/","google_rating":"4.8","google_reviews_count":854,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:38:59.113Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1552,"business_name":"The Illinois Hammer Injury Law Firm Dworkin & Maciariello","business_type":"law firm","address":"134 N LaSalle St STE 650, Chicago, IL 60602, USA","city":"Chicago","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(312) 857-7777","website":"https://illinoishammer.com/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gbp","google_rating":"4.5","google_reviews_count":1944,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:38:57.832Z","worst_review_text":"They DON'T communicate at all.

is more into relying on past reviews instead of improving. I was traveling with a tour group that was scheduled to leave the next day. I was hoping to speak to the tour person to confirm what was expected for check out but I was late in returning from a private tour so I asked the front desk staff if they could help me out. They said that the tour guide was done for the day and perhaps they could help. That was nice of them to say so but at times it is best to speak to the person you need to speak to for clarification. One person said the information was on the printed handout and that I should read it. I mentioned to him that because of a eye situation that effects me reading fine print, I can't see it. Other staff persons were very helpful but this person that told me to read it was difficult and not what I would expect from this hotel. I tried to make him aware that I was trying to confirm what I thought I was told but to no avail , he merely said suitcases will be picked up at 8am. One other staff read to me what the time for pick up was and to my amazement, it was a different time from what he told me. Some staff are great but this person made me feel that my questions were above and beyond him and it left me with the impression that asking questions may be snarled at by some staff.

I was charged $380 for a cut, dye, and style. Throughout the service, Marcus appeared very nonchalant, as if he didn’t want to work with my 4C hair, even though he is also Black.\n\nI originally requested a balayage, but Marcus said he couldn’t do it because of my hair length. Instead, he offered to do a base color, which I specifically asked to be copper, but that is not the color I received. He applied dye to my hair and I was just sitting there no cap was placed on my head to secure the treatment nothing total disregard and lack of compassion.

I had a good experience with him, and she had good reviews, so I scheduled with her. I did not have to pay for this appointment due to the quality of work, so I am writing this PURELY to warn others.\n\nI specifically booked a full highlight. When I sat in her chair, she looked through my hair and said it was already pretty blonde and that I would only need a partial. We went back and forth, and I emphasized that I need my roots to look freshly done, especially in up do’s, as my job is heavily presentation-focused. She again confirmed that a partial was recommended. I asked whether my roots would look done while half up/half down, and she confirmed yes and stated that she places foil all over, even on partials. I regrettably trusted her and went with her recommendation.\n\nThe appointment itself felt rushed and emphasis on messy. While contributive to the context, I am limited due to the character limit, so I digress.\n\nWhen finished, she only blow-dried the front section of my hair and then quite literally LEFT because she had a doctor’s appointment. I had a haircut booked with another stylist since she only does color, but she didn’t even stay to confirm the final result with me.\n\nWhile getting my hair cut, I asked for a mirror when my hair was sectioned half up/half down. I was truly horrified by how incomplete it looked. She had confirmed my roots would be touched up in this exact style, which was untrue. Upon further inspection, nowhere did the blonde reach my roots aside from the outer front, coincidentally the exact piece she blow-dried. It was laughably bad, even for a partial.\n\nI complained at the front, and because there was no manager on duty, they initially tried to send me away! Only after I pushed back on the verge of tears, stating that a luxury salon should have customer service available, did the front desk assistant call the manager, who forced a busy head stylist to speak with me. He kindly confirmed the work was indeed poorly done and needed to be re-colored. They attempted to reschedule me with the stylist who cut my hair, but I did not feel comfortable.\n\nManagement never contacted me to apologize. Laura texted me herself to confirm my appointment with the other stylist (why??) and days later, asked me to call her. Never sent a text or voicemail that would imply an apology, and maybe she would have, but I wasn’t interested. I genuinely believe she manipulated me into a partial so she could make her doctor’s appointment. Fortunately, I didn’t have to pay for this rock-bottom experience, but now I have to find a stylist to correct her subpar work.\n\nThe most ironic part is that during our appointment, I had mentioned a previous bad experience with another stylist. She said many stylists simply just don’t know what they’re doing! Based on these results, would you think Laura knows what’s she’s doing? What a JOKE.\n\nIn response to the Owner’s reply:\n- I am not sure how you can say management was involved when the front desk assistant tried to send me away due to there being no manager on duty. The head stylist that communicated with me after my appointment is quite literally in the background of my first picture attached doing someone’s hair.\n- I was offered an appointment with Jesus, who was very kind, but not a senior stylist. Not only is he the most affordable stylist on your website, but when I asked him if Laura was the only blonde specialist, he said yes. If your blonde specialist can’t even handle basic blonde coloring, why would I trust a novice stylist at your salon.\n- The text quite literally said, “Good morning Victoria, Laura here, are you available 12/24 time 12 with Jesus so we can re do the highlights?”. I will be adding this to my review.

During a procedure to disinfect the roots of an infected, root-canaled tooth, she told me local anesthesia would not help with the pain I felt. However, another dentist later performed the exact same procedure with local anesthesia, and I realized the pain I endured at Dr. Wick's was unnecessary. This is unacceptable, especially from a doctor specializing in treating anxious patients. It reflects a complete lack of care for the patient's well-being. I also felt rushed rather than cared for.

stayed at East Hotel Hamburg twice this year: the first time in May, which was wonderful. I loved the ambiance, the design, and especially the room with the large bathtub. Because of that great experience, I decided to book again in October through Navan (Expedia PartnerCentral) for a work trip, specifically selecting and paying for the Aqua Room.\n\nHowever, upon arrival, I was given a completely different room without the features of the category I had booked. When I showed my confirmed reservation, which explicitly stated Aqua Room, the front desk informed me that the error had come from the booking partner and their system that there was nothing they could do unless I paid an additional €35 to get the room I had already booked. After a long day of travel, I reluctantly paid the extra fee, even though the mistake was clearly between the hotel and the partner, not mine. Since I had other work-related plans and didn’t want to waste more time at the reception, I decided to resolve the matter with the hotel later.\n\nWhat disappointed me most was how the situation was handled afterward. Despite acknowledging that the issue came from their booking partner, management refused to refund the €35 and advised me to take it up with the external provider myself. This raises a serious question: how can any guest trust the hotel’s booking and notification system if, upon arrival, they can simply claim an error occurred and downgrade your room —> even when your company has already paid for a higher category?\n\nFor a hotel of this standard, I expected a much more professional and guest-focused resolution. It’s a beautiful property, but the lack of accountability and poor handling of this issue left a lasting negative impression.

Even when I show reference photos, the stylist never delivers what I ask for.\n\nAbout a year ago, I came in for a temporary straightening treatment. I repeatedly told the stylist—at least 10 times—that I did not want anything permanent, especially not keratin. I had previously done Hair Botox and Brazilian Blowouts at other salons, which were great because my curls always came back after a few months.\n\nDespite my clear instructions, he reassured me multiple times that the product would only last 3–4 months and that my curls would return. Ten months later, my roots are curly, but the rest of my hair is still pin-straight—clearly a keratin treatment.\n\nI went back to explain what happened and to get a trim with a voluminous blowout. Once again, I left with hair that was mostly flat and straight with a slight curl at the ends—definitely not a voluminous blowout. When I asked what product was used that one time I had asked for a temporary hair straightening treatment, they admitted it was keratin. When I reminded them that I had explicitly said not to use keratin, there was no apology or explanation.\n\nTo top it off, they barely offered a discount—and still asked for a tip after I paid. I’ve never had a salon do that, especially after an experience like this.\n\nUnless you’re going in for a basic trim and hairstyle, I can’t recommend this place.

One of the staff onsite (Anna) was incredible. Very helpful and good advice. Thats where the positives finished. The idea that this is considered to be a 4 star hotel is laughable. Budget hotel chains like Ibis, Holiday Inn and Travelodge which is vastly superior to this place in quality.\nThe towels are disgraceful. 2 ply toilet paper with one replacement for 3 days.

I hired them after my accident over a year ago, believing their “For The People” message and “no upfront cost” promise meant I would receive strong representation and basic professionalism. Instead, what I encountered was month after month of unanswered emails, vague updates, and constant delays — especially when it came time for them to finally close out my case and provide my statement.\nThe email chain speaks for itself.\nFor weeks, I repeatedly asked the same simple questions: “What is the status?”, “Do you have the closing statement?”, “Can you provide an update?” Every response I got — when I got one at all — was some version of “We’re waiting on another department,” “Hopefully today,” or “I’ll do my best.”\nMeanwhile, I was left completely in the dark.\nNo proactive communication.\nNo clear timeline.\nNo sense of urgency whatsoever.\nEven after sending them a voided check so they could “speed things up,” the delays continued. I kept being told “end of day,” “today or tomorrow,” and “soon”—yet nothing happened. I had to chase them down for every single piece of information, sometimes going days or weeks without any response at all.\nWhat makes this even more frustrating is that Morgan & Morgan takes a large percentage of any settlement, yet in my experience they provided minimal follow-through and poor customer service throughout the entire process. Their marketing paints a picture of a supportive, responsive law firm. In reality — at least in my case — it felt like dealing with a giant, automated system where real communication and real care were not part of the service.\nI expected professionalism.\nI expected timely responses.\nI expected transparency about my settlement and closing documents.\nInstead, what I got was delay after delay and a year-long process that should have been handled far more efficiently.\nIf you’re considering Morgan & Morgan because the commercials make them sound caring and accessible, I strongly suggest thinking twice. My experience shows a completely different side — one where the client is left waiting, guessing, and emailing endlessly just to get the most basic updates on their own case.\nI would not recommend them based on what I went through.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Andrew Reigle","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1463,"business_name":"Berlin Marriott Hotel","business_type":"hotel","address":"Inge-Beisheim-Platz 1, 10785 Berlin, Germany","city":"Berlin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"030 220000","website":"https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/bermc-berlin-marriott-hotel/overview/?scid=f2ae0541-1279-4f24-b197-a979c79310b0","google_rating":"4.5","google_reviews_count":3150,"email":"info@marriott.com","email_verified":false,"email_source":"upgrade_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"contacted","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:38:37.372Z","worst_review_text":"Overall I think it falls below a 5star hotel standard.\n\nCons -\n1.

The breakfast spread was very underwhelming and crowded at the executive lounge and we have no other options.\nIt’s only a small counter of F&B nothing like the usual 5star hotel breakfast spread. That looks really bad\n\nPros +\n1. Location is superb\n2. Room is huge (but not much view)\n3. Heated indoor pool (perfect for winter) & decent gym facilities\n4. Offers auto DIY shoe polisher at all levels\n5. Created festive mood at lobby on NYE\n6. Sweet gestures of drinks and snacks displayed in room upon check in and on New Year’s Day.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Kelly","ai_response_draft":"The towel with the capsule stuck on it is completely unacceptable - that's a basic housekeeping miss.

The next day I was asked to provide screen shots of my declaration page. After providing that information, and reaching out to confirm if the information I provided was what was needed I didn’t hear from anyone for 4 days with an apology. Shortly after I received a text, not a call, not an email, but a text that they couldn’t take my case because of the attorneys work load. I then called the office for a better explanation, and long story short my case wasn’t worth taking on. Daniel advised me that someone would call me back to give me suggestions on to move forward with my case, but days later I haven’t heard from anyone. Also, anytime I called the office the representative would answer only saying hello. No formal greeting from her at all.

Ultimately, when the demand was placed, there was incorrect information in the demand.\nWhen I reached out to Mr Earely, he initially did not take my call. When I finally got him in the phone he berated me and raised his voice and told me that they had never had received a bad review. He alluded to having many lawyers and 450 cases and scolded me for asking for his time. Alyssa asked me to trust her and was better at communicating until she went away again. It was a terrible experience. I eventually had to change to another firm as Alyssa was away again and no one ever seemed to pay attention to the details of my case.

I told her this is my first time getting a perm and asked if this is doable. She said my hair is too fine so only a more prominent perm will last for my hair. She showed me a picture and I said that's fine. She then asked if I want layers or cut my hair (She later tells me that me refusing the layers or cuts is the problem with the outcome. But she never explained that. She only asked if I want layers or cuts). I said no and to just perm my hair starting from the cheek area.\nThat's all the conversation we had.\n\nAfter she's done, I noticed that the curls were pretty low (picture of me in the green shirt. Pic I took once I got home that day).\nShe said this perm will last for 3 months and that I mustn't wash my hair for 48 hours.\n\nI did this perm on Wednesday afternoon so I washed my hair again on Friday night. As soon as I blow dried my hair, the curls were mostly gone.\n\nI contacted them the next day and sent pictures (the picture with the black shirt is what my hair looks like on Saturday) showing them my hair and asking for a refund. They said owner isn't there and that they'll contact me on Monday.\n\nOn Monday when they texted back to me (I think it was just Min and not the owner) , the only options they gave me were:\n1) I can go back to redo my perm but I refused because I don't want to damage my hair anymore (Also why would I want to go back to your store when I had such a bad experience).\n2) I can get 20% off any service within half a year (which is basically telling me to spend more money there).\nBut absolutely NO REFUND because they have a no refund policy.\n\nI understand that some stores, especially service industries, have no refund policy to avoid being scammed by customers. However, I feel that depending on the situation, exceptions should be made. And this is exactly that type of situation.\nIf the stylist did the job right and it's just a problem with the customers preference, then I totally understand. But my case is that I paid $400 for a perm that was promised would last 3 months, but it fell out in just 2 days.\n\nMin texted me back and this is what she wrote:\n\"I'm sorry to hear that and I understand how disappointed you are. But I'm not sure what your expectations of the perm were. Because the inspired photo that showed me was cutting layer and bang. And you refuse to have that If the hair cut isn't a similar result it would be a different style. I wish I could make you happier but I don't agree with this and if you go ask another stylist or salon I'm confident I wasn't wrong. We understand that our service may not have met your expectations. However as with restaurants and other businesses, we don't offer refunds simply because something didn't align with individual preferences.\"\n\nThis isn't a matter of preference. I do think that the problem could also be that my hair is just not fit for perming. But if so, I feel like she, the professional, should've said something. Just because the customer asked for it, it doesn't mean a hairstyle will work for them. The stylist also has the obligation to tell that to the customer and work something out so that both parties are happy. I do feel that this is no ones fault, but it still doesn't justify the amount I paid for such results.\n\nI showed my hair to all my friends and they all agree that this is unacceptable and a refund is definitely a must.\nI even asked for a partial refund and they still said no.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"Erica","ai_response_draft":"That's completely unacceptable - a $400 perm should last way longer than 2 days.

He was telling me my tires can blow anytime and tried to charged me $1100 for three tires and also telling me they was a leaked underneath my car and another $280 to fix if. . Wow unbelievable. Just went there for inspection and almost ripped $1400. I also got ticket coz my inspection date was expired on that day coz they failed my inspection purposely. Plus paid $38 for failed  inspection and I tipped the guy too. Went for an another location for inspection and the repair guy was very professional and he said my car is totally fine no need to do anything and passed my inspection.

has displayed nothing but deception in my business dealings with him. Choosing this lawyer has dragged me into a sea of shady business partners displaying zero accountability. I have filed formal complaints; in the interim I hope to deter others from getting tangled in his web of nepotism. After convincing me to use their colleagues for my property sales as well as to oversee the packing, storing and shipping of an entire house full of valuable heirloom antiques, they effectively stole my property. From the onset, bills were sent to me for  “expenses” and “services” without details such as hourly rates or itemized costs. When I asked to speak with Tasso personally, he flippantly insisted everything checked out and I continued to pay. I was not permitted to use the shippers of my choosing, who had a BBB presence. Their movers refused to speak with me in English, intentionally putting me in a position to constantly need the services of the lawyer so that I was constantly paying two people just to maintain storage or communicate. When I asked for my belongings to be shipped to me, Pardalis and his associates went dead silent. I have spent months reaching out to Pardalis for assistance in releasing my belongings from his clutches, month after month they strung me along with emails claiming they were “looking into it” until they stopped replying. As a point of reference, Tasso leaves glowing reviews on the business pages of his colleagues, while I alert him to blatant misconduct, he pretends to know nothing about what is transpiring. Perhaps he might  redirect his attention from inflating online ratings, to dealing with the the clients he is neglecting. My extensive, well documented correspondence with him and his associates reveal nothing more than a ring of defrauders believing they are beyond reproach.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"GAM","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1396,"business_name":"Kimmel & Silverman, P.C., New York Lemon Law Firm","business_type":"law firm","address":"1001 6th Ave 12th floor, New York, NY 10018, USA","city":"New York","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(800) 536-6652","website":"https://www.lemonlaw.com/new-york/","google_rating":"5.0","google_reviews_count":290,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:38:17.845Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1395,"business_name":"The Law Offices of Michael S.

It is not what I have come to expect, neither from Marriott nor a 5 star hotel. Room was up to par, but wait time for elevators was abysmal, and had an extremely negative service experience that indicates poor management. I wish I would have picked any other hotel.\n\nI chose the Zurich Marriott because I have status, had great stays with Marriott in the part, and wanted to treat my parents and brother to a nice weekend trip. Reception gave me a 1 drink voucher and explicitly offered that it could be extended to all 4 members of our booking. Staff member at Lenox Bar refused to honor it, sent me back to reception to get a second voucher, then continued to argue with me, insisted there was no misunderstanding, finally agreed after I flat out asked him whether he could make our drinks. I have no idea where this negativity came from, and would have just paid for the drinks if I had simply been given nonconflicting guidance. My parents were mortified and initially refused any drinks because they thought we'd actually done something wrong.\n\nI escalated the experience to Guest Relations via email a few hours later, and in a wildly tone deaf series of exchanges, Lisa clarified that the voucher should have only been for 1 drink, promised to discuss internally, and offered to personally welcome us with drinks next time. No skin off their backs and completely missed the point -- the drinks were never the problem. Ultimately, I was told 10,000 Marriott points \"reflects our effort to address the situation\" and that I should've escalated it to management at the time of so they could address it directly (fantastic use of my last few hours of family vacation.) Extremely frustrating experience and can't believe I paid for this.

There are so many good things to say about the decor - quirky, interesting, unique and beautifully curated public areas, the food - highly recommend the restaurant which serves some of the best middle eastern food I’ve had in a long time, the location - 10 minute walk from the station, lots going on in the area, the soundproofing - even though it’s a lively area the windows block out almost all of the noise from outside.||Unfortunately there were a few things that have prompted a poor review. These may be particular to me and may not bother other people. ||||1) no air conditioning. There’s apparently an ‘air cooling system’ in the rooms but we had it on the coldest setting and the room was way too hot to sleep comfortably in. We had such poor sleep because of this. ||||2) when you’ve barely slept, all you want is a coffee asap in the morning and there are no facilities to make a coffee or tea or anything in the room. The mini bar is free but it had just water (which is usually free anyway), two basic beers and a cola of some brand I didn’t recognise. So no coffee in the room meant having to wait until showered and dressed etc to go for breakfast.||||3) which brings me to the final point. The shower. There was no privacy as the shower had a clear door and as there wasn’t a bathroom as such (just a separate loo, separate shower, and the sink in the actual bedroom) it meant that you were showering with a clear door which offered no privacy at all from the main room. ||||I get that they’re branding as different and quirky, but honestly, for over £300 a night, I don’t expect no air conditioning, no coffee making facilities in the room, and no privacy to shower.

Unfortunately, our visit was a masterclass in how not to handle guests when things go wrong.\n\nThe issues began with a serious hygiene lapse. After our first course, a dark, curly hair was sitting wrapped around my newly placed silverware. The server didn't even notice the hair, and she placed it there herself!!!! When we pointed it out to her, the apology was scarce and perfunctory.\nWe are human, and we understand hiccups happen, so we decided not to make a fuss. What defines a top-tier restaurant, however, is its reaction. Here, there was no manager rushing over — just a quiet replacement of the utensils as if nothing had happened. We decided not to let it spoil the experience, even deleted the picture I took.\n\nThe second failure was environmental. Sitting by the window on a +27°C day, we were baking in the sun. It was September, so the management went through the summer with this, and we were probably not the first who complained.\nThe sun was blazing in, and while a curtain was shading another table, we were left in the heat. We asked for more shade, and while solar blinds were lowered, they did little to help. My husband was genuinely suffering. We asked for the manager, but only the floor supervisor came. We explained the problem, and then... nothing happened for 10-15 minutes. By the time our main course was being served, we were still waiting for a solution. In a truly awkward moment, my husband had to ask them to physically shift our table into a sliver of shade, which they did while our main dishes were on it. It was absurd.\n\nThe mood was completely spoiled. We decided to just push through and not let it ruin our vacation.\n\nThe true lack of professionalism was revealed at the end.\nTo add insult to injury, when we were leaving, we saw two perfectly unoccupied tables in a cooler, shaded section. I asked the floor supervisor about this, she claimed they had planned to move us after our main course. This excuse made no sense—why not move us and then serve the mains?\nWhen I recounted the hair incident to the supervisor, her \"sorry\" was utterly insincere, as if it was something regular and we were just picky. Shocking!!!!!\n\nIt's crucial to understand: this was a demonstration of the absolute lack of proper training and reaction. Hiccups are inevitable; a poorly trained staff that cannot manage them is not.\n\nAnd for the record, the bill and service charge were processed very smoothly—no complaints there.\n\nThe food was good (not excellent) and beewax as cooking agent was very interesting, but at this level, \"good\" isn't enough to justify the prestige and the highest level of the industry.\nAlso I have to be fair and mention fine linens and silverware, they were noticed.\nThe one standout was the wonderful man serving the bread cart—he and the bread selection  delivered a glowing positive experience.\n\nVerdict: Based on the combination of a hygiene lapse and a complete failure in service problem-solving, this is simply not a 3 Michelin star establishment. The lack of urgency, empathy, and a genuine apology was staggering. We expected an unforgettable meal, but for all the wrong reasons, that's exactly what we got.\n\nThis was a sharp contrast to our very recent visits to 2 Michelin star restaurants in Dublin and Mexico city.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Natalie Volkoff","ai_response_draft":"You're absolutely right - the hair on silverware and leaving you in blazing heat for that long isn't acceptable at any level.

It’s not cool to agree to a rate you’re given by hotel staff only to be told you are wrong and for staff to repeat and raise their voice at you. It doesn’t change the fact that it’s their mistake, not ours. That’s false advertising. The manager was called and he honored the price agreed to upon check in. In terms of reception & housekeeping service improvements and retraining is needed. It’s not at par with Marriott hotels we have stayed in all over the world.\n\nUPDATE 2: I removed another star because they don’t change used glasses to clean ones and they don’t restock the toiletries. We used up the earbuds and I needed one on the last night but there was no replacement.\n\n-\n\nThe exterior looks dated but the interiors have been wonderfully renovated. I love the modern gold details in the lobby. The cafe/bar and staircase is stunning.\n\nWhen we arrived at 6pm & our son’s sofa bed had not been made up, room towels were only for 2 with zero robes. We requested for 2 extra pillows in our booking but had to request 2 more times. They made the sofa bed but only brought 1 extra pillow.\n\nWhen we arrived tired in the evening it was convenient to eat at the Champions Sports Restaurant on the ground floor or EG. Big servings and delicious food.\n\nMy son and husband were excited to swim, but after requesting and waiting we were told that there are no robes and they aren’t sure if there are towels by the pool. On 29 Dec 80pm there were too many people in the pool area. It was chaotic. The next day they went to the pool first thing and it was much better. But sad they only got to swim once. Still no robes.\n\nThe breakfast buffet is only €19/person and half for kids. It’s good value so we decided to eat in the hotel for breakfast. It was very crowded. (UPDATE: So this was wrong according to reception upon  check out who repeated this to us multiple times like we were hard of hearing. The manager had to be called)\n\nThere is a 24/7 Market by the lobby which has some free infused water & refreshments. We bought sparkling water but had no need to because they supply fresh Bavarian mineral water (still or sparkling) on water stations around the hotel. They have a refillable glass bottle in the room which is good value and more environmentally friendly than plastic bottles.\n\nOne the 2nd day we got the extra pillow and the robes delivered to our room but the robes were too late.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"UnDiplomatic Wife","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1359,"business_name":"Premier Inn München City Zentrum Hotel","business_type":"hotel","address":"Sonnenstraße 25, 80331 München, Germany","city":"München","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"089 83931640","website":"https://www.premierinn.com/de/de/hotels/deutschland/bayern/muenchen/muenchen-city-zentrum.html?cid=GLBC_MUNCIT","google_rating":"4.3","google_reviews_count":1398,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:37:20.641Z","worst_review_text":"NEVER AGAIN!\n\nWe were traveling with friends and a child and planned to spend two days in Munich.

The service would send a letter to the hotel, and the hotel would refund the full amount — that was the stated procedure. They assured us that they fully understood the situation, checked our reservation once again, and guaranteed a refund, while asking us to leave the hotel so as not to create a queue, as there were many guests.\n\nAfter sending an email, I received a reply of just two sentences and a 90% cancellation penalty, despite the fact that my message was sent one month before the January 2026 check-in date. I wrote another email explaining the situation again and recounting the conversation we had with the hotel staff when we were there. The reply I received was simply a copy of the same message they had sent before.\n\nThe result: a 90% penalty, additional expenses for an emergency same-day accommodation search in Munich, catching a cold from waiting outside, and ruined Christmas holidays!

Lots of alcoholics, drug addicts, migrants in the park - I don't recommend leaving late.\n3) The room has no infrastructure. No kettle, dishes.\n4) The staff either does not fulfill requests, or does them reluctantly. I asked to prepare breakfast, since we were leaving early, before breakfast. In Thailand for example with the same situation, they prepared a lunchbox for me. The hotel employee deceived me that there would be ALL food at 5 am. There were yesterday's croissants, and that's all - NOTHING ELSE - Is it really so difficult for a person with a paid breakfast to pack a sandwich and yogurt?\nThe staff is intended to give advices and toxic comments (staff are speaking about you, your style, money etc near you).\n5) Dusty room and bed linen.\n6) The elevator takes forever, there is no separate elevator for cleaning ladies and equipment.

The nearby garden is also a nice feature. However, when compared to other Mercure hotels and their standards, this property falls short in several areas, except for cleanliness.\n\nThe room facilities are outdated. For example, the television is extremely old and only offers basic channels, there is no Smart TV, so streaming services like Netflix are not possible. The carpets are worn and visibly old, especially on the floor, and it is clear that no major renovation has taken place in at least the past 15 years.\n\nThe bathroom layout is particularly inconvenient and unhygienic: the toilet is located in a very small separate room near the entrance door, which also contains the only full-length mirror. To wash your hands, you must leave the toilet, cross the sleeping area, and go to the shower room, which is far from ideal.\n\nThe minibar is free, which is appreciated, and includes water, beer, Coca-Cola, and orange juice, as offered in some Mercure hotels. However, the room was cold due to old windows that do not properly insulate against low temperatures.\n\nBreakfast was very disappointing. The scrambled eggs were unappealing, as new batches were continuously mixed with old ones, giving them an unpleasant, meat-like appearance. The bread and pastries were mostly not fresh; the cakes, in particular, were extremely dry and seemed to come from a discount supplier. The selection was limited, and live or show cooking was practically non-existent. Additionally, tables were often not properly prepared; we frequently had to look for cutlery and napkins ourselves or partially clean tables before sitting down.\n\nConsidering the price of over €370 per night, the overall experience was extremely poor. As an Accor member entitled to a welcome drink, the service was so underwhelming that I did not even feel inclined to use the minibar during my four-day stay. While the idea of an older, charming hotel can be appealing, at this price point I would honestly rate an Ibis Budget higher, as it offers better amenities and service. Apart from the housekeeping staff, no one ever asked about my stay, not even during checkout.\n\nOverall, this was not a good experience. The hotel urgently needs to focus on improving room standards, customer care, service quality, and especially the breakfast offering.","worst_review_rating":2,"worst_review_author":"Rodrigue Nanfack-Kirchmann","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1305,"business_name":"Schnitzel Wirt","business_type":"restaurant","address":"Neubaugasse 52, 1070 Wien, Austria","city":"Wien","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"01 5233771","website":"http://www.schnitzelwirt.co.at/","google_rating":"4.4","google_reviews_count":11656,"email":"info@schnitzelwirt.co.at","email_verified":false,"email_source":"upgrade_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"contacted","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:19:05.579Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1304,"business_name":"Lakeshore Dental Care","business_type":"dental office","address":"5020 Lake Shore Rd, Hamburg, NY 14075, USA","city":"Hamburg","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(716) 627-7200","website":"https://www.lakeshoredentalcare.com/","google_rating":"5.0","google_reviews_count":732,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:19:04.636Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1303,"business_name":"Affordable General Dentistry & Implants","business_type":"dental office","address":"198 Main St, Hamburg, NY 14075, USA","city":"Hamburg","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"(716) 649-5280","website":"http://www.affordabledmd.com/","google_rating":"4.3","google_reviews_count":66,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:19:04.413Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1302,"business_name":"Hamburg Dental Care - Barry N.

This issue had been discussed over the phone earlier, and we were assured that the vehicle would fit. Morning front desk gave us a parking space immidiately – without any problem.

usually start with the good things about a restaurant first, but I honestly have nothing to start with here. If I could leave a negative 5 star review, I would. The service was slow, our appetizer was brought to the wrong table and it took 20 minutes just to get that. The wings were luke warm, soggy, and flavorless when they finally came out. I had to choke down 3 of them only because I was starving at this point. The carrots were WHITE, and the celery was nearly limp and had no crunch at all. The Bleu cheese portion was the smallest I have ever seen in WNY. My daughter's chicken tenders were also terrible. I could see and taste chunks of uncooked corn meal in the breading. The fries were OK, but nothing more than frozen fries from a bag. As for cleanliness, we had flies all over our table and food the entire time we were there. It's probably from the condensation from the A/C that was dripping on us the whole time and literally causing the floor beneath us to mold. When we told the waitress about it, she said \"yeah, that's an issue at this table\". She never once asked us how the food was, even after taking away full plates of uneaten food and us telling her we didn't want a take out box. Even if we wanted to tell her, we only saw her once about 15 minutes after we got our food. This is seriously the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant ever.

While the waiter apologized when I pointed this out, and the drink was rectified, no compensation was initially offered. It wasn't until I specifically requested it when the bill arrived that any form of compensation was provided. We also noticed that our server gave a detailed \"knife talk\" to all other tables, explaining the different steak knives available. However, when our food was served, we were simply given a generic knife and it was just placed on the table, with no explanation whatsoever. Later, our side dishes were also brought out incorrectly, requiring another correction. Finally, when we were ready to pay, the same server spent a good ten minutes chatting with another table, completely ignoring us and another table that was also patiently waiting to settle their bill. These repeated errors in service and a clear lack of attention really detracted from the evening.\n\nAs for the food, it was just \"alright.\" The steak was nothing special, and I've certainly had better elsewhere. The sides were also uninspiring and didn't elevate the meal in any way.\n\nOverall, while the food was acceptable, the poor service was the main issue. The lack of proactive compensation for their mistakes, the unprofessional demeanor of our server, the noticeable disparity in service between our table and others, and the extended wait to pay were particularly frustrating. I wouldn't recommend based on this experience.","worst_review_rating":3,"worst_review_author":"Kenneth Lai","ai_response_draft":"That's a lot of service mistakes in one night - the mocktail mix-up and missing knife talk especially shouldn't have happened.

A SMALL bag costs 6 euros for 24 hours or 3 euros for just 3 hours. Who is keeping their bag for 24 hours? Most tourists need storage for maybe 4 to 6 hours. There are no flexible options, just overpay or suffer. It feels greedy and unfair, especially for a hostel.\n\nThe showers were another joke. Every time you shower, the drain is clogged and the water builds up around your feet. This is not a one time problem. It is clearly known and they never fix it. Standing in dirty water while showering is not exactly what anyone wants after a long day of sightseeing.\n\nThe toilets were also disappointing. They were not cleaned every day, which is unacceptable in a busy hostel with so many people sharing facilities.\n\nThen there are the long term residents. Some very shady and dodgy people seem to live there permanently. They clearly do not shower, smell bad, and honestly look mentally disturbed. It made the place feel uncomfortable and unsafe at times. Not the vibe most travelers are looking for.\n\nThe only decent things about this hostel were the location and the breakfast. The location is great, and the breakfast is actually good for 6 euros if you buy it on the day of check in. Sadly, those two things are not enough to make up for everything else.\n\nOverall, this place feels more like a budget shelter with extra fees than a traveler friendly hostel.

No guest—especially a child—should ever be treated this way under any circumstances.\n\nThis behavior shows a total lack of basic hospitality, courtesy, and training. A hotel that allows staff to scream at guests and treat families with such disrespect should seriously reconsider its customer service standards.\n\nWhen my son came back from the restrooms, the same hotel receptionist came back, alongside her staff member, and began lecturing him on the rules of the hotel, raising their voice, and even saying outright they didn't belong in the hotel.\n\nWe expected a welcoming and family-friendly environment. Instead, we left feeling upset, disrespected, and deeply disappointed. The rest of the hotel staff was indeed helpful and nice, but the two at the reception completely ruined the experience. I would not recommend this hotel to families or anyone who expects basic politeness and professionalism.","worst_review_rating":1,"worst_review_author":"An Ze","ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":true,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1239,"business_name":"Hotel Berlin, Berlin, a member of Radisson Individuals","business_type":"hotel","address":"Lützowpl. 17, 10785 Berlin, Germany","city":"Berlin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"030 26050","website":"https://www.radissonhotels.com/en-us/hotels/radisson-individuals-berlin?cid=a:se+b:gmb+c:emea+i:local+e:ri+d:cese+h:DEBERAAA","google_rating":"4.1","google_reviews_count":8990,"email":"info@radissonhotels.com","email_verified":false,"email_source":"upgrade_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"unsubscribed","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:18:43.340Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1238,"business_name":"MEININGER Hotel Berlin Mitte Humboldthaus","business_type":"hotel","address":"Oranienburger Str. 67-68, 10117 Berlin, Germany","city":"Berlin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":null,"website":"https://www.meininger-hotels.com/en/hotels/berlin/hotel-berlin-center/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=BER-OS&utm_content=website","google_rating":"4.0","google_reviews_count":3269,"email":"info@meininger-hotels.com","email_verified":false,"email_source":"upgrade_scrape","contact_name":null,"status":"unsubscribed","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:18:43.103Z","worst_review_text":null,"worst_review_rating":null,"worst_review_author":null,"ai_response_draft":null,"has_bad_review":false,"lead_type":"restaurant","competitor_platform":null,"pain_points":null,"platform_url":null,"job_title":null,"company_size":null,"review_quote":null,"outreach_angle":null,"demo_token":null,"demo_url":null,"twitter_handle":null,"facebook_page":null,"instagram_handle":null,"linkedin_company":null,"google_business_url":null,"contact_form_url":null,"channels_contacted":{},"google_place_id":null},{"id":1237,"business_name":"Homaris West Side","business_type":"hotel","address":"Bundesallee 31A, 10717 Berlin, Germany","city":"Berlin","state":null,"country":"US","phone":"030 439796905","website":"https://my.homaris.de/search/offers?PROPERTY_IDS=21201","google_rating":"4.0","google_reviews_count":1327,"email":null,"email_verified":false,"email_source":null,"contact_name":null,"status":"new","source":"turbo_scrape","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:18:42.867Z","worst_review_text":"Dont go there.

Sadly, Hilton Berlin has gone from a great hotel to one of the worst-managed Hilton properties I’ve stayed in.\n\nThe spa has been out of order for years with no real progress. The executive lounge was moved into the middle of the lobby, completely losing the quiet, relaxing atmosphere it used to have. The lobby itself now feels uncomfortable, with sofas replaced by basic chairs.\n\nService has also dropped dramatically. Almost every time I arrive, there is only one person at reception, leading to long queues. Even at checkout at 10:00 a.m., I had to wait 15 minutes because only one staff member was working — unacceptable for a hotel of this level.\n\nBreakfast is overcrowded with no available seating. And the suite I stayed in was shocking: bad smell, toilet not working properly, broken taps. It felt like a three-star hotel, not a Hilton.\n\nI’ve stayed loyal to Hilton for many years, but Hilton Berlin has become so poorly managed that I’m seriously reconsidering that loyalty.

I see, that they have just picked up my frame, to start working on it. That is how I got my glasses after an hour. I know, that if I would have not gone there, to put pressure on them, they would take 4 hours to put the glasses in.\nTo sum it up: I pay a fortune for some lenses, that I will probably need to replace after 2 years.

Once for lunch and once for a late breakfast. Looked to be a decent place, but the paintings were crooked for some inexplicable reason. Not just off a little bit, but purposely hung crooked. I'm sorry, but that takes away from the otherwise cozy atmosphere.\n\nLunch: we ordered a craft mocktail, an avocado and egg bread, and a schnitzel. The schnitzel was good, no real complaints at all. The bread item was... lacking. It was very cold, and wet, and soggy, to our dismay, because the taste itself was good. To be fair, it didn't actually say \"toast\" on the menu, but one would expect such an item to be toasted. The mocktail was good with fresh raspberries. Good service this time around.\n\nWe thought to give it another go for our late breakfast. Ordered pancakes, a caesar wrap, scrambled eggs and bacon, and a bread and cheese plate. The description for the bread was a bit confusing, and the server really didn't know how to explain the choices properly either. After quite some time, a completely different server brought our food to us. The pancakes cost €8,50 for some very small and sad cakes. The menu only says you get five but doesn't give a size, and at that price, it almost feels deceitful. The eggs were okay, but they forgot the bacon. This was corrected in a timely manner, by the second waiter.\n\nThe bread was ok, but the caesar wrap was something else. Firstly, I have never in my life heard of a hot caesar wrap. Maybe the chicken inside would be hot, but not the whole thing. I'm guessing it was baked, but whatever they did to it was completely ass backwards. The lettuce was wilted and hot, the dressing turned into a runny mess, and the chicken was just warm somehow. Biting into it caused it to explode the hot, runny sauce. It fell apart under its own liquids shortly after, and we resorted to eating it with a knife and fork. That barely worked, but this is a horrible menu item.\n\nAfter we finally finished we waited around for some 20 minutes. Our server was running around but just wouldn't come back to the table, even though our plates were cleared by someone else. I was tired of waiting so I hailed another server for our check. Pretty bad service the second visit with middling food. I wouldn't recommend this place.","worst_review_rating":3,"worst_review_author":"sigmaphisigma a","ai_response_draft":"The hot caesar wrap was a mistake - that shouldn't have been served like that.
